Description: Implementation of adaptive p-value thresholding (AdaPT), including both a framework that allows the user to specify any 
  algorithm to learn local false discovery rate and a pool of convenient functions that implement specific 
  algorithms. See Lei, Lihua and Fithian, William (2016) <arXiv:1609.06035>.
