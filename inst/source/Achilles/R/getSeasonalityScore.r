#'@title Get the seasonality score for a given monthly time series
#'
#'@description The seasonality score of a monthly time series is computed as its departure from a uniform distribution.
#'
#'@details
#' The degree of seasonality of a monthly time series is based on its departure from a uniform distribution.
#' If the number of cases for a given concept is uniformly distributed across all time periods (in this case, all months), 
#' then its monthly proportion would be approximately constant.  In this case, the time series would be
#' considered "strictly non-seasonal" and its "seasonality score" would be zero.
#' Similarly, if all cases recur at a single point in time (that is, in a single month), such a time series would be considered
#' "strictly seasonal" and its seasonality score would be 1.  All other time series would have
#' a seasonality score between 0 and 1.  Currently, only monthly time series are supported.
#'    
#'@param tsData  A time series object.
#'
#'@return A numeric value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the seasonality of a time series.
