Title: Consistency in the Analytic Hierarchy Process
Version: 1.0.1
URL: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AHPtools
Description: An integrated set of functions for building, analyzing, and visualizing 
 Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) models, designed to support structured decision-making
 in consultancy, policy analysis, and research (Bose 2022 <doi:10.1002/mcda.1784>; 
 Bose 2023 <doi:10.1002/mcda.1821>). In addition to tools for assessing and improving the 
 consistency of pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs), the package supports 
 full-hierarchy weight computation, intuitive tree-based visualization, sensitivity 
 analysis, along with convenient PCM generation from user preferences.
