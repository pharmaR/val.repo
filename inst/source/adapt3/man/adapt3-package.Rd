\title{Adaptive Dynamics and Community Matrix Model Projections}
\description{
Runs projections of groups of matrix projection models (MPMs),
allowing density dependence mechanisms to work across MPMs. This package was
developed to run both adaptive dynamics simulations such as pairwise and
multiple invasion analysis, and community projections in which species are
represented by MPMs. All forms of MPMs are allowed, including integral
projection models (IPMs).
}
\details{
The adapt3 package provides three categories of functions:

1. Core projection

2. Function characterizing relationships among MPMs

3. Functions describing, summarizing, or visualizing results

adapt3 also includes example datasets complete with sample code.
