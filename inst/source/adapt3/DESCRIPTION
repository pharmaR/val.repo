Description: Runs projections of groups of matrix projection models (MPMs),
             allowing density dependence mechanisms to work across MPMs. This
             package was developed to run both adaptive dynamics simulations
             such as pairwise and multiple invasibility analyses, and community
             projections in which species are represented by MPMs. All forms of
             MPMs are allowed, including integral projection models (IPMs). Also
             includes individual-based modeling (IBM) versions of these.
