Description: Implements the Age Band Decomposition (ABD) method for 
 standardizing tree ring width data while preserving both low and high frequency 
 variability. Unlike traditional detrending approaches that can distort long term 
 growth trends, ABD decomposes ring width series into multiple age classes, detrends 
 each class separately, and then recombines them to create standardized chronologies. 
 This approach improves the detection of growth signals linked to past climatic and 
 environmental factors, making it particularly valuable for dendroecological and 
 dendroclimatological studies. The package provides functions to perform ABD-based 
 standardization, compare results with other common methods (e.g., BAI, C method, RCS), 
 and facilitate the interpretation of growth patterns under current and future climate 
 variability.
