#' @title ABD - Age Band Decomposition
#'
#' @description
#' ABD - Age Band Decomposition. This function calculates 
#' standardized tree-ring width chronologies by decomposing 
#' tree-ring width (stdTRW) data into age bands, detrending 
#' each age band separately, and then recombining them to 
#' produce the mean standardized chronology. 
#' Specifically, ABD standardizes each series within its 
#' age band (e.g., each ring width is divided by the corresponding 
#' age-specific expected value from the stdTRW). 
#' Then, standardized values from all age bands are merged and 
#' averaged to produce a composite chronology, preserving both 
#' inter-annual and low-frequency climate signals.
#'
#' @param inTRW
#' tibble. A tibble. The input dataset obtained from 
#' the `TRW_readExcel()` function.
#' 
#' @param min_nTrees_year 
#' Numeric. The minimum number of trees per year required within each age class 
#' to be included in the analysis. 
#' The default is 3. 
#' Using less than three trees may result in poor representation of within-class 
#' variability and is not recommended unless data availability is limited.
#'  
#' @param pct_stdTRW_th Numeric. It defines the threshold for the minimum 
#' proportion of standardized tree-ring width values required within a given 
#' age class. 
#' The default is set to 0.5, 
#' meaning that at least 50% of the possible 
#' values must be present (e.g., 6 out of 10 values for 10-year age bands, 
#' or 11 out of 20 for 20-year bands). 
#' For instance, the final age band of a 94-year-old tree 
#' (i.e., the 91â€“100-year band) includes only 4 years of growth. 
#' Since this number of years below the threshold, we recommend 
#' excluding that tree from the corresponding age band group.
#'
#' @param pct_Trees_th Numeric. It defines the threshold used to calculate 
#' the mean standardized tree-ring widths within each age band. 
#' The default value is 0.3. 
#' However, when working with small sample sizes (approximately 20 trees or fewer), 
#' it is advisable to increase the threshold to 0.5. 
#' This adjustment helps retain more trees in the analysis while still 
#' accounting for natural growth variability.
#' 
#' @return
#' A tibble with the following columns: year, N_ageBands, ABD, and ABDsd.
#' 
#' @details
#' The function performs age-band decomposition on stdTRW data by filtering out 
#' age classes with insufficient observations (`min_nTrees_year`) or 
#' excessive within-class variation.
#' 
#' The `stdTRW_th` value is particularly important in small datasets: 
#' too strict a threshold may exclude valid data. 
#' If working with approximately 20 trees or fewer, 
#' a threshold of 0.5 is suggested.
#' 
#' Please, see the `Examples` section below for a 
#' demonstration using a typical input tibble obtained with `TRW_readExcel()`.
