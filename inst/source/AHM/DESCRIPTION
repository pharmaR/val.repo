Description: An implementation of the additive heredity model for the mixture-of-mixtures experiments of Shen et al. (2019) in Technometrics <doi:10.1080/00401706.2019.1630010>. The additive heredity model considers an additive structure to inherently connect the major components with the minor components. The additive heredity model has a meaningful interpretation for the estimated model because of the hierarchical and heredity principles applied and the nonnegative garrote technique used for variable selection.
