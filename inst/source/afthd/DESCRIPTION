Package: afthd
Type: Package
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2021-10-01
Description: Functions for Posterior estimates of Accelerated Failure Time(AFT) model with MCMC and Maximum likelihood estimates of AFT model without MCMC for univariate and multivariate analysis in high dimensional gene expression data are available in this 'afthd' package.
            AFT model with Bayesian framework for multivariate in high dimensional data has been proposed by Prabhash et al.(2016)
