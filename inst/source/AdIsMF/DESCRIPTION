Description: The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms are pivotal in characterizing adsorption processes, essential across various scientific disciplines. Proper interpretation of adsorption isotherms involves robust fitting of data to the models, accurate estimation of parameters, and efficiency evaluation of the models, both in linear and non-linear forms. For researchers and practitioners in the fields of chemistry, environmental science, soil science, and engineering, a comprehensive package that satisfies all these requirements would be ideal for accurate and efficient analysis of adsorption data, precise model selection and validation for rigorous scientific inquiry and real-world applications. Details can be found in Langmuir (1918) <doi:10.1021/ja02242a004> and Giles (1973) <doi:10.1111/j.1478-4408.1973.tb03158.x>.
