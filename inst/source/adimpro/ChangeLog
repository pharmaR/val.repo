version 0.8.0: 07.02.2013
- partial parallel implementation usin openMP

version 0.7.7: 31.07.2012
- spell check by CRAN revealed a misspell in DESCRIPTIOn file

version 0.7.6: 18.10.2011

version 0.7.6: 30.06.2011
- changed arg gamma to arg gammatype for make.image at those places
  where it has been forgotten (known from R CMD check NOTE on CRAN)

version 0.7.4: 06.04.2010

- new-line in Makevars

version 0.7.3: 13.11.2009

- adimpro.options() no longer suggests to use X11.options(type="Xlib") -> no message at startup!
- adimpro.options() sets display size from xdpyinfo only on Linux systems -> no error on MAC OS
- new functions adimpro2biOps() and biOps2adimpro() for interchange of objects between both packages

version 0.7.1: 6.10.2008

.onload: X11.options(type="Xlib") is no longer enforced 
         Instead a comment is added suggesting to use X11.options(type="Xlib")
         X11.options(type="Xlib") will be set automatically if 
         a system environment variable R_X11type is set to Xlib.

version 0.7: 16.9.2008

Demosaicing: 
- new demosaicing algorithm in demosaic.raw based on multivariate medians (methods="Median4")
- adaptive smoothing of raw images controled by new demosaicing algorithm.

Manipulation:
- new option gammatype="histogram" allows for (greyvalue) histogram equalization (and to reverse
equalization) in adjust.image, write.image, show.image and plot. Histogram information is stored as
component hequal .
- new argument maxrange in read.raw, develop.raw and awsraw allows to increase range of
sensor values as far as possible by a linear transform.

version 0.7: 14.7.2008

Smoothing:

- awsimage, awspimage and awsaniso now use a sequence of bandwidths
  that provides an possible decrease in variance of 1.25 from step to step.
  This sequence depends on the kernel.
  This also solves a problem of underestimating variances for the 
  "Quadratic" and "Cubic" location kernel.
  awsaniso now also allows for "Plateau" as location kernel.
  "Uniform" location kernel does not work in this context and is therefore no longer supported
test code for segmentation in files segment.r and segment.f

bug-fixes: 
- rotate.image now handles sums of weights correctly
- awsaniso did not return component ni0 causing an possible error in plot
  for objects created by the function

version 0.6.3.1: 02.6.2008

bug-fixes only
- read.raw: typo in file name manipulations
- demo(io) needed some time between issuing two system calls. 
  Sometimes the process started with the first system call
  was unnkown to the second that asks for the process ID
  of the first. 
- shrink.image caused error if applied to an image created by awsimage

version 0.6.3: 20.5.2008

- adimpro now writes temporary files into the directory used by function tempfile()
- corrected handling (identification)  of greyvalue images in read.image 


version 0.6.1: 14.5.2008

this version incorporates several new features from the development version

Input/Output:

- we now keep exif information as comment of an image 
  this information is evaluated to recover the original adimpro-object
  used to produce the image file, see demo(io).
  This may be changed to using rpm-profiles.
- new function write.raw provides a possibility to store 
  RAW sensor data as a greyscale png-image
  these images are recognized by read.raw, see demo(raw).
- write.image now keeps color space by default
- read.image/write.image now also handles xyz, yuv, yiq and 
  hsi color spaces correctly
- the location of ImageMagick is now automatically determined 
  using function Sys.which and set as an environment variable 
  ImageMagick when the package is loaded (This requires R >=2.6.0). 
  The argument convert.path in read.image and write.image is no 
  longer needed and has been removed.
- make.image no longer has an argument gamma


Adaptive smoothing:

- functions awsimage, awspimage:

- value of ladjust      1.0 -- 1.25, different lseq
- new arguments plateau=NULL, homogen=TRUE, earlystop=TRUE
- new varmodel "Quadratic"
- location kernel with choice "Plateau"
- statistical kernel changed to Plateau with spmin=0.25
- FORTRAN subroutine awsimg has fewer parameters
- lseq extended (if it is to short) by last element rather than by 1 
- FORTRAN subroutine awsvimage has differing parameters
- FORTRAN subroutine mawsimg has fewer parameters
- FORTRAN subroutine awspimg has fewer parameters
- handles lower/uppercase for some arguments

- new function awsprop for testing propagation condition

- new function awsaniso for anisotropic structural adaptive smoothing

Color space conversions: 

- increased and changed functionality of adjust.image
- rgb2xxx  also accepts colorspaces xyz , yuv and yiq
- xxx2rgb - functions now allow to specify RGB-color space (default "Adobe")
- new function cam2rgb for conversion of camera color spaces to RGB
- new funcions rgb2xyzmat and xyz2rgbmat 
- function gamma.correction  now uses gammatype instead of arguments ga and bp
- new function for inverse gamma correction
- new function whitepoint, wpofT, changewhitepoint  for white point definitions and manipulation
- whitebalance no uses whitepoint and color temperature 
- adjust.image  now allows to set gammatype, cspace, whitep, color temperature blackpoint and exposure
- new function demosaic.raw to convert RAW sensor data to RGB


Image manipulations and diagnostics:

- function edges has a new argument abs
- functions shrink.image, rotate.image, clip.image also accept "RAW"
- rotate.image has new argument compress
- new function extract.info for extracting EXIF-Information

Bug fixes: e.g. in make.image, invgamma.correction (internal),
           read.ppm(internal), read.pgm(internal),

Demos:

We added an extensive set of demos. 
demo(adimpro) just runs all demos sequentially. Especially
demo(awspimage) (local polynomial smoothing) is time consuming.

version 0.4.6: 16.4.2008
