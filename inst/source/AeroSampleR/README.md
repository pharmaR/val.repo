AeroSampleR is an R package to help estimate the fraction of aerosol
particles that make their way through an air sampling system.

## Installation

You can install the released version of AeroSampleR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("AeroSampleR")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markhogue/AeroSampleR")
```

## Overview

Air sampling systems are in use in nuclear facilities and other
facilities that have a potential for hazardous airborne particles.
Ambient air is drawn in at one end of a system through a probe, and
directed through tubing components (e.g. straight lines, bends).

As the air sample progresses through the system, some particles deposit
along the way on the inside of the tubing. How much is lost depends on a
number of factors, such as particle size, system length, bend diameter,
etc.

AeroSampleR relies on the concept of aerodynamic median activity
diameter (AMAD), which accounts for particle density and shape, leaving
equivalent spherical water droplets as the modeling targets.

Efficiency functions are based predominantly on testing with aerosol
particles through stainless steel tubing. These models are only valid
for clean systems. If a system is coated on the inside with years of
material accumulation, or if the system is unprotected from
environmental factors that could produce interior condensation, then
there should be no expectation that the models will produce a realistic
result.

At this time, only relatively simple systems can be modeled with
AeroSampleR. Components evaluated include:

-   a blunt probe in calm air
-   straight lengths of tubing
-   tubing bends (three bend modeling options are included)

Not included:

-   more complicated sampling probes (as are typically used in stacks
    and ducts)
-   sample line splitters
-   changes in tube diameter - only one diameter is modeled for a whole
    system
-   the endpoint of the sample is assumed to be directed straight to an
    air sample filter or other detection system. Additional losses are
    likely inside any detection system that requires the air stream to
    travel circuitous routes.

The following is an example evaluation of a simple sampling system:

Initiate a table of data populated with particle diameters

``` r
df <- particle_dist() # no entries = default particle sizes
#> 
#> 
#> 
#> _mean_ diameter for AMAD (median activity) =  0.9427043
```

The mean is shown above. The mean is used to derive the particle
distribution using the `stats::dlnorm` function. The mean has to first
be derived for the lognormal particle distribution with the median and
standard deviation that are used as arguments to the `particle_dist`
function.

Add the system parameters

``` r
params <- set_params_1("D_tube" = 2.54, # 1 inch diameter
                       "Q_lpm" = 100, # ~3.53 cfm
                       "T_C" = 25, # 77 F
                       "P_kPa" = 101.325) # Atmospheric pressure at sea level
```

Add particle size dependent parameters

``` r
df <- set_params_2(df, params)
```

Start the system with a probe oriented upwards (“u”)

``` r
df <- probe_eff(df, params, orient = "u")
```

Our system has a 90 degree bend after the probe. We’re using the Zhang
model

``` r
df <- bend_eff(df, 
               params, 
               method = "Zhang",
               bend_angle = 45,
               bend_radius = 0.1,
               elnum = 2) #each element after the probe should be numbered
```

Next, our system has a straight line to the detector

``` r
df <- tube_eff(df, 
               params, 
               L = 1, # 1 meter
               angle_to_horiz = 0,
               elnum = 3)
```

That’s the whole system. As we added elements, our table of data added
columns. Let’s look under the hood at the data frame (df) we made. We’ll
look at the end where the discrete values start.

``` r
print.data.frame(df[1001:1003, ], digits = 2, row.names = FALSE) #formatted to fit
#>  D_p probs     dist C_c    v_ts    Re_p     Stk eff_probe eff_bend_2 eff_tube_3
#>    1     1 discrete 1.2 3.6e-05 2.3e-06 0.00094         1       1.00       1.00
#>    5     1 discrete 1.0 7.7e-04 2.5e-04 0.02023         1       0.98       0.99
#>   10     1 discrete 1.0 3.0e-03 1.9e-03 0.07954         1       0.93       0.92
```

Let’s evaluate - discrete first

``` r
 report_basic(df, params, "discrete")
#> System Parameters
#> All values in MKS units, except noted
#> Notes: D_tube is in m.
#> Q_lpm is system flow in liters per minute.
#> velocity_air is the derived air flow velocity in meters per second.T_K is system temperature in Kelvin.
#> P_kPa is system pressure in kiloPascals.
#> Re is the system Reynolds number, a measure of turbulence.
#>   microns   sys_eff
#> 1       1 0.9987645
#> 2       5 0.9712557

```
