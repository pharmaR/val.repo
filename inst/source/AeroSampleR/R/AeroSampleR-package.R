#' Estimate Aerosol Particle Collection Through Sample Lines
#'
#' This package provides a method to estimate sampling
#' efficiency of sampling systems drawing aerosol particles
#' through tubing.
#'
#' Functions were developed consistent with the approach
#' described in Hogue, Mark; Thompson, Martha; Farfan,
#' Eduardo; Hadlock, Dennis, (2014), "Hand Calculations for
#' Transport of Radioactive Aerosols through Sampling Systems"
#' Health Phys 106, 5, S78-S87, <doi:10.1097/HP.0000000000000092>.
