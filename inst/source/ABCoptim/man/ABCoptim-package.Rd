\title{An implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm}
\description{
This is an implementation of Karaboga (2005) ABC optimization algorithm. It
was developed upon the basic version programmed in \code{C} and distributed
at the algorithm's official website (see the references).
}
\details{
Please consider that this version is in alpha state of development, thus any
evident (precision) error should be blaimed to the package author (not to
the algorithm itself)
