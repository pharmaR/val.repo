# Python 3 wrapper and Junyper Notebook examples

This folder contains the `Python 3` module `adherer.py` that implementes the `Python 3` wrapper for `AdhereR`, as well as two examples of using `AdhereR` from `Python 3 Junypper Notebooks`.
While `jupyter_notebook_python3_wrapper.ipynb` shows the use of the Python 3 wrapper to compute and plot CMAs, `jupyter_notebook_python3_py2.ipynb` shows the same thing but using the more generic `rpy2` mechanism (which, however, results in a shlightly clunckier code).
