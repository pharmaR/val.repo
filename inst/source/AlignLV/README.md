# Description
Coming soon!

# Example

# Installing from source
We recommend installing the latest development version of this package from Github to ensure use of the latest and greatest version. To do so:
1. Install the `devtools` package if you haven't. In R, this can be done using the following code:
`install.packages('devtools')`
2. Load the `devtools` package using the following code:
`library(devtools)`
3. Install the `AlignLV` package using `install_github()` using the following code:
```
devtools::install_github('mmansolf/AlignLV',build_vignettes=T)
```
The `,build_vignettes=T` is optional but recommended for viewing the vignette accompanying this package (COMING SOON).
The `AlignLV` package is not yet on CRAN, so trying to install it with `install.packages()` will not work. This is coming soon!

## Other installation options
While the above method should work for most users, there are alternatives:
* The `ghit` library has an analogous `ghit::install_github()` function to that in the `devtools` package
* Download the package as a .zip file, then run the following code and interactively select the .zip file to install:
`install.packages(file.choose(), repos = NULL, type = "source")`
