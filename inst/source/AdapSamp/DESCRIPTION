Description: For distributions whose probability density functions are log-concave, the adaptive rejection sampling algorithm can be used to build envelope functions for sampling. For others, we can use the modified adaptive rejection sampling algorithm, the concave-convex adaptive rejection sampling algorithm and the adaptive slice sampling algorithm. So we designed an R package mainly including 4 functions: rARS(), rMARS(), rCCARS() and rASS(). These functions can realize sampling based on the algorithms above.
