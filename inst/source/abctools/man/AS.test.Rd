\title{
Test for relative approximate sufficiency between two posterior samples.
}
\description{The function tests to determine adding a (set of) statistics is informative in ABC inference.}
\usage{
AS.test(grid = 10, x1, x2, supp=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{grid}{the number of bins into which to divide the posterior sample for the approximate sufficiency calculation.}
  \item{x1}{the posterior sample using the first set of summary statistics.}
  \item{x2}{the posterior sample using the second (alternative) set of summary statistics.}
%  \item{prior}{a single letter specifying the prior which generated the parameter values, e.g ."u" (uniform) or "n" (normal).}
  \item{supp}{the "support" of the prior (e.g. uniform bounds).}
}
\details{After dividing each posterior sample into a number of bins (specified by \code{grid}), the function computes the ratio of the posterior densities.  This is seen as a measure of information added (sufficiency) by using the alternative posterior sample instead of the first posterior sample.  If the ratio exceeds a particular threshold (a number of standard deviations away from the expected counts in each bin), then the alternative set of summaries is seen as being more informative.}
\value{
\item{extreme}{a boolean value indicating whether the alternative posterior sample is more informative than the first (i.e. the extra summary statistics add information.}
