\title{Works out entropy of a sample.}
\description{
The function computes the k nearest neighbour sample entropy.}
\usage{
nn.ent(th, k=4)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{th}{The sample from which to compute the entropy.}
  \item{k}{The order (number of neighbours) of the sample entropy calculation.}
}
\details{The sample entropy gives a measure of information in a (posterior) sample, or lack of it.}
\value{ The k nearest neighbour entropy from the sample.}

For high-dimensional posterior samples, the \code{nn.ent} calculation is quite computationally intensive.
