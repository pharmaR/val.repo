Description: 
  Provides tools for classical parameter estimation of adsorption isotherm models, including both 
  linear and nonlinear forms of the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin isotherms. This package allows 
  users to fit these models to experimental data, providing parameter estimates along with fit statistics 
  such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Error metrics are 
  computed to evaluate model performance, and the package produces model fit plots with bootstrapped 95% 
  confidence intervals. Additionally, it generates residual plots for diagnostic assessment of the models. 
  Researchers and engineers in material science, environmental engineering, and chemical engineering can 
  rigorously analyze adsorption behavior in their systems using this straightforward, non-Bayesian approach.
