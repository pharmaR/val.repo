Description: Provides functions to express clock time data relative to 
    anchor points (typically solar); fit kernel density functions to animal 
    activity time data; plot activity distributions; quantify overall 
    levels of activity; statistically compare activity metrics through 
    bootstrapping; evaluate variation in linear variables with time (or 
    other circular variables).
