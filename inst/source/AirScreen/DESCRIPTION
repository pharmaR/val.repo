Description: Implements two complementary high-dimensional feature screening
    methods, Adaptive Iterative Ridge High-dimensional Ordinary Least-squares
    Projection (Air-HOLP, suitable when the number of predictors p is greater
    than or equal to the sample size n) and Adaptive Iterative Ridge Ordinary
    Least Squares (Air-OLS, for n greater than p). Also  provides helper
    functions to generate compound-symmetry and AR(1) correlated data, plus
    a unified Air() front end and a summary method. For methodological details
