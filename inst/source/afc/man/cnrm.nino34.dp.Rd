\description{
Dichotomous observations (obsv) and discrete probabilistic forecasts (fcst)
of the Nino-3.4 index for January 1961-2000. The forecast data stem from
model runs initialized using data for the preceding August 1960-1999.
Definition of an "event" in the observations: obsv >= 27 C. The
probabilistic forecasts have been estimated by taking the fraction of
ensemble members predicting the event.
}
\details{
The forecast data are from the coupled ocean-atmosphere model of the Centre
National de Recherches Meteorologiques (CNRM) of Meteo France and were
generated as part of the "Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble
System for Seasonal to Interannual Prediction (DEMETER)" project (Palmer et
al. 2004). Note that also the examples presented in the 2AFC paper by Mason
and Weigel (2009) are based on these data.
