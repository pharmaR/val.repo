Description: Implements the Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling (AMIS) algorithm, as described by Retkute et al. (2021, <doi:10.1214/21-AOAS1486>), to estimate key epidemiological parameters by combining outputs from a geostatistical model of infectious diseases (such as prevalence, incidence, or relative risk) with a disease transmission model. Utilising the resulting posterior distributions, the package enables forward projections at the local level.
