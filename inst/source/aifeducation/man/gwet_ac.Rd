\title{Calculate Gwet's AC1 and AC2}
\usage{
gwet_ac(rater_one, rater_two, additional_raters = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rater_one}{\code{factor} rating of the first coder.}

\item{rater_two}{\code{factor} ratings of the second coder.}

\item{additional_raters}{\code{list} Additional raters with same requirements as \code{rater_one} and \code{rater_two}. If
there are no additional raters set to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{list} with the following entries
\itemize{
\item ac1: Gwet's Agreement Coefficient 1 (AC1) for nominal data which is unweighted.
\item ac2_linear: Gwet's Agreement Coefficient 2 (AC2) for ordinal data with linear weights.
\item ac2_quadratic: Gwet's Agreement Coefficient 2 (AC2) for ordinal data with quadratic weights.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates Gwets Agreement Coefficients.
}
\note{
Weights are calculated as described in Gwet (2021).

Missing values are supported.
