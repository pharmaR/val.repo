version 0.3 18 October 2018
* ABPS now prints warnings when the parameters are outside the range
  used by the algorithm
* When an unnamed vector was used with the ABPS function, the assumed
  order was incorrect

version 0.2 30 January 2018

* OFFscore function now assumes that haemoglobin level (HGB) is
  specified in [g/dL], instead of [g/L] previously. This makes the
  package more coherent. Examples and documentation were modified
  accordingly.
* OFFscore now accepts a data frame as argument
* ABPS and OFFscore now both check that arguments are not passed
  simultaneously as a data frame and as separate parameters
* Update of documentation (correction of some incoherencies between
  pages, and general improvements)
