# Version 1.2.2

* The creation of the pdfs showing the Stuve diagram within the examples of CAPE_CIN function and the aiRthermo package were omitted to comply with CRAN's requirements.

# Version 1.2.1

* The Stuve_diagram function has been deeply updated. Line colours, types and widths are user-adjustable in this version. Additionally, the lines included in the plot are available until 20 hPa and the limits of both axis can be changed according to this value. 

* A previous bug introduced in version 1.2 that prevented the constant mixing ratio lines to appear in the diagram has been solved. Thanks to Dr. Clemens Dr√ºe for reporting us about it. 

# Version 1.2

* Corrected some parts of the internal C function that computes CAPE and CIN that were executed when upToTop is TRUE. There is no need to change calling programs. The structure of return values hasn't changed, either.

* Some parts of the manual have been corrected.

# Version 1.1

* The TTindex function was updated after an error found in the code (reported by the CRAN team).
