Description: An application for analysis of Adverse Events, as described in Chen, et al., (2023) <doi:10.3390/cancers15092521>.
             The required data for the application includes demographics, follow up, adverse event, drug administration and optional tumor measurement data.
             The app can produce swimmers plots of adverse events, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox Proportional Hazards model results
             for the association of adverse event biomarkers and overall survival and progression free survival.
             The adverse event biomarkers include occurrence of grade 3, low grade (1-2), and treatment related adverse events.
             Plots and tables of results are downloadable.
