Description: The empirical cumulative average deviation function introduced by the author is utilized to
             develop both Ad- and Ud-plots. The Ad-plot can identify symmetry, skewness, and outliers of the
             data distribution, including anomalies. The Ud-plot created by slightly modifying Ad-plot is
             exceptional in assessing normality, outperforming normal QQ-plot, normal PP-plot, and their 
             derivations. The d-value that quantifies the degree of proximity between the Ud-plot and the graph
             of the estimated normal density function helps guide to make decisions on confirmation of 
             normality. Full description of this methodology can be found in the article by Wijesuriya (2025)
