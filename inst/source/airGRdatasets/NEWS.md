### 0.2.1 Release Notes (2023-07-11)

#### User-visible changes

- correct the list of catchment areas to match the map in the 'lumped_daily' help page. The catchment area 'F', 'G', and 'H' were not ordered correctly. ([#11](https://gitlab.irstea.fr/HYCAR-Hydro/airgrgalaxy/airgrdatasets/-/issues/11))
- update the catchment areas list to be consistent with the latest version of the CAMELS-FR dataset. Catchment areas 'A341020001' and 'V121401001' have been replaced by 'A273011002' and 'V123521001' respectively, as they have been removed from the CAMELS-FR sample. ([#10](https://gitlab.irstea.fr/HYCAR-Hydro/airgrgalaxy/airgrdatasets/-/issues/10))


#### Version control and issue tracking

- add unit tests to check dataset format ([#12](https://gitlab.irstea.fr/HYCAR-Hydro/airgrgalaxy/airgrdatasets/-/issues/12))
