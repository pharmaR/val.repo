  More especially, it can be used by teachers and students for hydrological modeling exercises adapted to the 'airGRteaching' package as described in Delaigue et al. (submitted) and in the 'airGRteaching' vignettes.

 The package contains the following types of datasets:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{\link{lumped_daily}}: a set of lumped catchment daily hydrometeorological time series, and associated metadata.
