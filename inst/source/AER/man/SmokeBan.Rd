\details{
\code{SmokeBank} is a cross-sectional data set with observations on 10,000 indoor workers, which
is a subset of a 18,090-observation data set collected as part of the National Health
Interview Survey in 1991 and then again (with different respondents) in 1993.
The data set contains information on whether individuals were, or were not, subject to a workplace
smoking ban, whether or not the individuals smoked and other individual characteristics.
