\description{Growth regression data as provided by Durlauf & Johnson (1995).}

\usage{data("GrowthDJ")}

\format{
A data frame containing 121 observations on 10 variables.
\describe{
 \item{oil}{factor. Is the country an oil-producing country?}
 \item{inter}{factor. Does the country have better quality data?}
 \item{oecd}{factor. Is the country a member of the OECD?}
 \item{gdp60}{Per capita GDP in 1960.}
 \item{gdp85}{Per capita GDP in 1985.}
 \item{gdpgrowth}{Average growth rate of per capita GDP from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).}
 \item{popgrowth}{Average growth rate of working-age population 1960 to 1985 (in percent).}
 \item{invest}{Average ratio of investment (including Government Investment) to GDP 
   from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).}
 \item{school}{Average fraction of working-age population enrolled in secondary school
   from 1960 to 1985 (in percent).}   
 \item{literacy60}{Fraction of the population over 15 years old that is able to read 
   and write in 1960 (in percent).}  
}
}

\details{
The data are derived from the Penn World Table 4.0 and are given in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992),
except \code{literacy60} that is from the World Bank's World Development Report.
