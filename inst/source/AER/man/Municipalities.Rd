Total expenditures contains both capital and current expenditures. 

Expenditures, revenues, and grants are expressed in million SEK. The 
series are deflated and in per capita form. The implicit deflator is a 
municipality-specific price index obtained by dividing total local 
consumption expenditures at current prices by total local consumption 
expenditures at fixed (1985) prices. 

The data are gathered by Statistics Sweden and obtained from 
Financial Accounts for the Municipalities (Kommunernas Finanser).
