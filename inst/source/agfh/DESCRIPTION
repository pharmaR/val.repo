Description: Implements the Agnostic Fay-Herriot model, an extension of 
    the traditional small area model. In place of normal sampling errors, the 
    sampling error distribution is estimated with a Gaussian process to 
    accommodate a broader class of distributions. This flexibility is most 
    useful in the presence of bounded, multi-modal, or heavily skewed sampling 
    errors.
