Description: 
    Provides cross-validation tools for adsorption isotherm models, supporting both linear and non-linear forms. 
    Current methods cover commonly used isotherms including the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin models. 
    This package implements K-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) with optional clustering-based
    fold assignment to preserve underlying data structures during validation. Model predictive performance is assessed 
    using mean squared error (MSE), with optional graphical visualization of fold-wise MSEs to support intuitive evaluation of model accuracy. 
    This package is intended to facilitate rigorous model validation in adsorption studies and aid researchers in selecting robust isotherm models.
