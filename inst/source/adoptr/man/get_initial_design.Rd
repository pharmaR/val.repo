\description{
The optimization method \code{\link{minimize}} requires an initial
design for optimization.
This function provides a variety of possibilities to hand-craft designs that
fulfill type I error and type II error constraints which may be used as initial designs.
}
\details{
The distribution of the test statistic is specified by \code{dist}.
The default assumes a two-armed z-test.
The first stage efficacy boundary and the \eqn{c2} boundary are chosen as Pocock-boundaries, so either \eqn{c_e=c_2}
if \eqn{c_2} is constant or \eqn{c_e=c}, where the null hypothesis is rejected if \eqn{w_1 Z_1+w_2 Z_2>c}.
By specifying \eqn{ce}, it's clear that the boundaries are not Pocock-boundaries anymore, so the type I error
constraint may not be fulfilled.
IMPORTANT: When using the t-distribution or ANOVA, the design does probably
not keep the type I and type II error, only approximate designs are returned.
