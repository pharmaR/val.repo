\title{Two-stage design for time-to-event-endpoints}
\description{
When conducting a study with time-to-event endpoints, the main interest is not the
sample size, but the number of overall necessary events. Thus, \pkg{\link{adoptr}} does not use
the sample size for calculating the design. Instead,
it uses the number of events directly.
In the framework of \pkg{\link{adoptr}}, all the calculations are done group-wise, where both of the groups are equal-sized.
This means, that the number of events \pkg{\link{adoptr}} has computed is only half of the overall number of necessary events.
In order to facilitate this issue, the look of the
\code{summary} and \code{show} functions have been changed in the survival analysis setting.
The sample size is implicitly determined
by dividing the number of events by the event rate. Survival objects are only
created, when the argument \code{event_rate} is not missing.
