activity.summary.custom.period reads in a csv file containing a list
    of events files and csv files with time periods of interest (the first two
    columns should have the start date and end date in the format dd-mm-yy HH:MM).
    A summary table is saved to a csv file for each events file.  A further csv
    file giving a summary for all the events file is also generated.  The generated
    summary activity table for each events file is saved to a csv file, while an
    additional csv file containing the summaries across all the processed events
    files is also saved.
