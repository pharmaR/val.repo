\title{Processes events files to produce histograms showing the distribution of stepping and
    weighted median stepping cadence across two groups of stepping bout duration.}
\usage{
stepping.cadence.bands.folder.two.stepping.groups(input_folder,
  output_folder, generate_charts = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_folder}{The filepath for the folder where the events files to be processed are saved}

\item{output_folder}{The filepath for the folder where the generated files are to be saved}

\item{generate_charts}{Set TRUE if stacked histograms showing the distribution of stepping
cadences are to be generated for each events file. Default = TRUE}
}
\description{
Processes a folder of events files and generates a faceted set of histograms
    for each events file showing the duration of stepping in different cadence bands (each
    cadence band has a width of 10 steps per minute) for stepping bouts of duration 10
    seconds to 1 minute and 1 minute plus.  The weighted median cadence of stepping at
    each stepping bout duration is also calculated and indicated on the histogram.
    The values of the weighted median cadence for each stepping duration across all the
    processed events files is also returned as a data.frame.

output_folder <- paste(tempdir(),"/",sep="")

activPAL::stepping.cadence.bands.folder.two.stepping.groups(input_folder,output_folder,TRUE)
# Omitting a value for generate_charts results in the charts being saved in the output folder.
