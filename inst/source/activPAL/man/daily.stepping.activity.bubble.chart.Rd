\description{
Processes a folder of events files to output bubble charts showing
    the daily distribution of stepping cadences.
    A bubble chart shows daily patterns in stepping behaviour.  For each
    valid day of activity data a bubble is plotted on the chart.  The
    centre of bubble indicates the weighted median cadence of all stepping
    bouts of duration between 10 seconds and one minute (x-axis position)
    and the weighted median cadence of all stepping bouts of duration greater
    than or equal to one minute (y-axis position).  The height of a bubble
    indicates the weighted upper quartile  (y - max) and lower quartile
    (y - min) cadence across the stepping bouts of duration greater than or
    equal to one minute occurring during the given day.  The width of a bubble
    indicates the weighted upper quartile  (x - right) and lower quartile
    (x - left) cadence across the stepping bouts of duration between 10 seconds
    and one minute occurring during the given day.
    Each bubble chart is saved as a .png image.
