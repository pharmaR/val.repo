\title{Combines events file data with observational data across multiple events files
to produce and save charts}
\usage{
activity.with.overlay.chart.folder(index_file_location, output_folder)
}
\arguments{
\item{index_file_location}{The filepath for the csv file with the following column names
file_id, events_file, overlay_file}

\item{output_folder}{The filepath of the folder where the generated chart are to be saved to}
}
\description{
Reads in a csv file containing a list of events file locations and
    overlay file locations, generating and saving spiral and linear charts for
    each events file aligning the events file data with the corresponding overlay
    data.
    Where the overlay data is non-continuous data (such as sleeps diaries) the
    csv file should have the columns start_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM),
    end_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM) and category (text).
    Where the overlay data is continuous data (such as continuous glucose monitoring)
    the csv file should have the columns start_time (dd-mm-YYYY HH:MM) and
    category (text).  In this case the end time coincides with the start time of
    the subsequent observation.
    The charts are saved as png images with two images generated for each events
    file / overlay file pair (one spiral chart and one linear chart). \cr
    \strong{Note}: Spiral plots are generated using ggplot2 and coord_polar() and can take
    45 - 60 seconds to generate each spiral plot.
