Description: Contains data from an observational study concerning possible effects of light daily alcohol consumption on survival and on HDL cholesterol.  It also replicates various simple analyses in Rosenbaum (2025a) <doi:10.1080/09332480.2025.2473291>.  Finally, it includes new R code in wgtRankCef() that implements and replicates a new method for constructing evidence factors in observational block designs.
