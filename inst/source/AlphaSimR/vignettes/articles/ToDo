SimpleGeneticSimulations
  In this vignette I will show how genetic simulations work using a simple examples. 
  I will start by showing how to simulate phenotypes from genotypes. I will then 
  show how to simulate new genotypes from existing genotypes.
  
  ## Simulating phenotypes from genotypes
  
  Simulating phenotypes from genotypes is a straightforward process that can be 
  done fairly easily using just base R functionality.
