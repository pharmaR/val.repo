\title{Import inbred, diploid genotypes}
\usage{
importInbredGeno(geno, genMap, ped = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{a matrix of genotypes}

\item{genMap}{genetic map as a data.frame. The first
three columns must be: marker name, chromosome, and 
map position (Morgans). Marker name and chromosome are 
coerced using as.character. See \link{importGenMap}}

\item{ped}{an optional pedigree for the supplied 
genotypes. See details.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{MapPop-class}} if ped is NULL,
otherwise a \code{\link{NamedMapPop-class}}
}
\description{
Formats the genotypes from inbred, diploid lines 
to an AlphaSimR population that can be used to 
initialize a simulation. An attempt is made to 
automatically detect 0,1,2 or -1,0,1 genotype coding. 
Heterozygotes or probabilistic genotypes are allowed, 
but will be coerced to the nearest homozygote. Pedigree 
information is optional and when provided will be 
passed to the population for easier identification 
in the simulation.
}
\details{
The optional pedigree can be a data.frame, matrix or a vector. 
If the object is a data.frame or matrix, the first three 
columns must include information in the following order: id, 
mother, and father. All values are coerced using 
as.character. If the object is a vector, it is assumed to only 
include the id. In this case, the mother and father will be set 
to "0" for all individuals.

\examples{
geno = rbind(c(2,2,0,2,0),
             c(0,2,2,0,0))
colnames(geno) = letters[1:5]

genMap = data.frame(markerName=letters[1:5],
                    chromosome=c(1,1,1,2,2),
                    position=c(0,0.5,1,0.15,0.4))

ped = data.frame(id=c("a","b"),
                 mother=c(0,0),
                 father=c(0,0))

founderPop = importInbredGeno(geno=geno,
                              genMap=genMap,
                              ped=ped)
