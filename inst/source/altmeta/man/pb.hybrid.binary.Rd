\title{
Hybrid Test for Publication Bias/Small-Study Effects in Meta-Analysis With Binary Outcomes
}
\description{
Performs the hybrid test for publication bias/small-study effects introduced in Lin (2020), which synthesizes results from multiple popular publication bias tests, in a meta-analysis with binary outcomes.
}
\usage{
pb.hybrid.binary(n00, n01, n10, n11, data, methods,
                 iter.resam = 1000, theo.pval = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n00}{
  a numeric vector or the corresponding column name in the argument \code{data}, specifying the counts of non-events in treatment group 0 in the collected studies.
}
  \item{n01}{
  a numeric vector or the corresponding column name in the argument \code{data}, specifying the counts of events in treatment group 0 in the collected studies.
}
  \item{n10}{
  a numeric vector or the corresponding column name in the argument \code{data}, specifying the counts of non-events in treatment group 1 in the collected studies.
}
  \item{n11}{
  a numeric vector or the corresponding column name in the argument \code{data}, specifying the counts of events in treatment group 1 in the collected studies.
}
  \item{data}{
  an optional data frame containing the meta-analysis dataset. If \code{data} is specified, the previous arguments, \code{n00}, \code{n01}, \code{n10}, and \code{n11}, should be specified as their corresponding column names in \code{data}.
}
  \item{methods}{
  a vector of character strings specifying the publication bias tests to be included in the hybrid test. They can be a subset of \code{"rank"} (Begg's rank test; see Begg and Mazumdar, 1994), \code{"reg"} (Egger's regression test under the fixed-effect setting; see Egger et al., 1997), \code{"reg.het"} (Egger's regression test accounting for additive heterogeneity), \code{"skew"} (the skewness-based test under the fixed-effect setting; see Lin and Chu, 2018), \code{"skew.het"} (the skewness-based test accounting for additive heterogeneity), \code{"inv.sqrt.n"} (the regression test based on sample sizes; see Tang and Liu, 2000), \code{"trimfill"} (the trim-and-fill method; see Duval and Tweedie, 2000), \code{"n"} (the regressoin test with sample sizes as the predictor; see Macaskill et al., 2001), \code{"inv.n"} (the regressoin test with the inverse of sample sizes as the predictor; see Peters et al., 2006), \code{"as.rank"} (the rank test based on the arcsine-transformed effect sizes; see Rucker et al., 2008), \code{"as.reg"} (the regression test based on the arcsine-transformed effect sizes under the fixed-effect setting), \code{"as.reg.het"} (the regression test based on the arcsine-transformed effect sizes accounting for additive heterogeneity), \code{"smoothed"} (the regression test based on the smoothed sample variances under the fixed-effect setting; see Jin et al., 2014), \code{"smoothed.het"} (the regression test based on the smoothed sample variances accounting for additive heterogeneity), \code{"score"} (the regression test based on the score function; see Harbord et al., 2006), and \code{"count"} (the test based on the hypergeometric distributions of event counts, designed for sparse data; see Schwarzer et al., 2007). The default is to include all aforementioned tests.
}
  \item{iter.resam}{
  a positive integer specifying the number of resampling iterations for calculating the p-value of the hybrid test.
}
  \item{theo.pval}{
  a logical value indicating whether additionally calculating the p-values of the tests specified in \code{methods} based on the test statistics' theoretical null distributions. Regardless of this argument, the resampling-based p-values are always produced by this function for the tests specified in \code{methods}.
}
}
\details{
The hybrid test statistic is defined as the minimum p-value among the publication bias tests considered in the set specified by the argument \code{methods}. Note that the minimum p-value is no longer a genuine p-value because it cannot control the type I error rate. Its p-value needs to be calculated via the resampling approach. See more details in Lin (2020).
}
\value{
This function returns a list containing p-values of the publication bias tests specified in \code{methods} as well as the hybrid test. Each element's name in this list has the format of \code{pval.x}, where \code{x} stands for the character string corresponding to a certain publication bias test, such as \code{rank}, \code{reg}, \code{skew}, etc. The hybrid test's p-value has the name \code{pval.hybrid}. If \code{theo.pval} = \code{TRUE}, additional elements of p-values of the tests in \code{methods} based on theorectical null distributions are included in the produced list; their names have the format of \code{pval.x.theo}. Another p-value of the hybrid test is also produced based on them; its corresponding element has the name \code{pval.hybrid.theo}.
