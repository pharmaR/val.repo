\description{
Creates an additive relationship matrix A from a pedigree data in a 3-column way format based on ploidy level (an even number) and, if ploidy equals 4, based on proportion of parental gametes that are IBD (Identical by Descent) due to double reduction. Returns a dominance relationship matrix if dominance true (ploidy 2 only). Autopolyploid matrices based on Kerr (2012), used when `ploidy` argument is higher than `2` and `dominance=FALSE`.
Diploid additive numerator relationship matrix built as in Henderson (1976), used when `ploidy=2` and `dominance=FALSE`. Diploid dominance numerator relationship matrix built as in Cockerham (1954), used when `ploidy=2` and `dominance=FALSE`. For details of recursive method see Mrode (2005).
