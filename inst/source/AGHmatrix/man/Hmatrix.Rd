\value{
H Matrix with the relationship between the individuals based on pedigree and corrected by molecular information
}
\description{
Given a matrix A and a matrix G returns a H matrix. H matrix is the relationship matrix using combined information from the pedigree and genomic relationship matrices. First, you need to compute the matrices separated and then use them as input to build the combined H matrix. 
Two methods are implemented: `Munoz` shrinks the G matrix towards the A matrix scaling the molecular relatadness by each relationship classes; 
`Martini` is a modified version from Legarra et al. (2009) where combines A and G matrix using scaling factors. When method is equal `Martini` and `tau=1` and `omega=1` you have the same H matrix as in Legarra et al. (2009).
