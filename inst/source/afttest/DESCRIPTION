Description: A collection of model checking methods for semiparametric accelerated 
    failure time (AFT) models under the rank-based approach. For the (computational)
    efficiency, Gehan's weight is used. It provides functions to verify whether the 
    observed data fit the specific model assumptions such as a functional form of 
    each covariate, a link function, and an omnibus test. The p-value offered in this 
    package is based on the Kolmogorov-type supremum test and the variance of the 
    proposed test statistics is estimated through the re-sampling method. Furthermore, 
    a graphical technique to compare the shape of the observed residual to a number of 
    the approximated realizations is provided.
