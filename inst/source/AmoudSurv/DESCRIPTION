Description: Fits tractable fully parametric odds-based regression models for survival data, including proportional odds (PO), accelerated failure time (AFT), accelerated odds (AO), and General Odds (GO) models in overall survival frameworks. Given at least an R function specifying the survivor, hazard rate and cumulative distribution functions, any user-defined parametric distribution can be fitted. We applied and evaluated a minimum of seventeen (17) various baseline distributions that can handle different failure rate shapes for each of the four different proposed odds-based regression models. For more information see Bennet et al., (1983) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780020223>, and Muse et al., (2022) <doi:10.1016/j.aej.2022.01.033>.
