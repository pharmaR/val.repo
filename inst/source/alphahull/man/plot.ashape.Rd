\title{Plot the alpha-shape}
\description{
    This function returns a plot of the \eqn{\alpha}-shape. If desired, it also adds the Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram of the sample. 

}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ashape}(x, add = FALSE, wlines = c("none", "both", "del", "vor"),
	wpoints = TRUE, number = FALSE, col = NULL, 
	xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, lwd = NULL, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
 \item{x}{Object of class \code{"ashape"}.}
\item{add}{Logical, if TRUE add to a current plot.} 
 \item{wlines}{"Which lines?". I.e. should the Delaunay triangulation be plotted (wlines='del'), should the Voronoi diagram be plotted (wlines='vor'), should both be plotted (wlines='both'), or none (wlines='none', the default)?}
 \item{wpoints}{Logical, indicates if sample points should be plotted.}
\item{number}{Logical, defaulting to FALSE; if TRUE then the points plotted will be labelled with their index numbers.}  
 \item{col}{The colour numbers for plotting the \eqn{\alpha}-shape, data points, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, and the point numbers, in that order; defaults to c(1,1,1,1,1). If fewer than five numbers are given, they are recycled. (If more than five numbers are given, the redundant ones are ignored.)}
\item{xlim}{The limits on the x-axis.}  
\item{ylim}{The limits on the y-axis.}
  \item{lwd}{The line widths for plotting the tesselations and the \eqn{\alpha}-shape; defaults to c(1,2).}
  \item{\dots}{Arguments to be passed to methods, such as graphical parameters (see \code{\link{par}}).}
