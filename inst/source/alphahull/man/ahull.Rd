\title{alpha-convex hull calculation}
\description{
This function calculates the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull of a given sample of points in the plane for \eqn{\alpha>0}.
}
\usage{
ahull(x, y = NULL, alpha)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x, y}{The \code{x} and \code{y} arguments provide the \code{x} and \code{y} coordinates of a set of points. Alternatively, a single argument \code{x} can be provided, see Details.}
  \item{alpha}{Value of \eqn{\alpha}.}
}
\details{

An attempt is made to interpret the arguments x and y in a way suitable for computing the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull. Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is acceptable, see \code{\link{xy.coords}}. 

The \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull is defined for any finite number of points. However, since the algorithm is based on the Delaunay triangulation, at least three non-collinear points are required. 

If \code{y} is NULL and \code{x} is an object of class \code{"delvor"}, then the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull is computed with no need to invoke again the function \code{\link{delvor}} (it reduces the computational cost). 

The complement of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull can be written as the union of \eqn{O(n)} open balls and halfplanes, see \code{\link{complement}}. 
The boundary of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull is formed by arcs of open balls of radius \eqn{\alpha} (besides possible isolated sample points). The arcs are determined by the intersections of some of the balls that define the complement of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull. The extremes of an arc are given by \eqn{c+rA_\theta v} and \eqn{c+rA_{-\theta}v} where \eqn{c} and \eqn{r} represent the center and radius of the arc, repectively, and \eqn{A_\theta v} represents the clockwise rotation of angle \eqn{\theta} of the unitary vector \eqn{v}. Joining the end points of adjacent arcs we can define polygons that help us to determine the area of the estimator , see \code{\link{areaahull}}.

\value{
 A list with the following components:
  \item{arcs}{For each arc in the boundary of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull, the columns of the matrix \code{arcs} store the center \eqn{c} and radius \eqn{r} of the arc, the unitary vector \eqn{v}, the angle \eqn{\theta} that define the arc and the indices of the end points, see Details. The coordinates of the end points of the arcs are stored in \code{xahull}. For isolated points in the boundary of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull, columns 3 to 6 of the matrix \code{arcs} are equal to zero. }
  \item{xahull}{A 2-column matrix with the coordinates of the original set of points besides possible new end points of the arcs in the boundary of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull.}
\item{length}{Length of the boundary of the \eqn{\alpha}-convex hull, see \code{\link{lengthahull}}.}  
\item{complement}{Output matrix from \code{\link{complement}}.}
\item{alpha}{Value of \eqn{\alpha}.}
\item{ashape.obj}{Object of class \code{"ashape"} returned by the function \code{\link{ashape}}.}
