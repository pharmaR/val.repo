Description: Model adsorption behavior using classical isotherms, including Langmuir,
    Freundlich, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Temkin models. The package supports
    parameter estimation through both linearized and non-linear fitting techniques and
    generates high-quality plots for model diagnostics. It is intended for environmental
    scientists, chemists, and researchers working on adsorption phenomena in soils,
    water treatment, and material sciences. Functions are compatible with base 'R' and
    'ggplot2' for visualization.
