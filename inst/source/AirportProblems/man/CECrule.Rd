\title{Constrained equal contributions rule}
\usage{
CECrule(c)
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{A numeric cost vector.}
}
\value{
A numeric contribution vector, where each element represents the payment of the different agents.
}
\description{
\code{CECrule} calculates the contribution vector selected by the CEC rule.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{N^i_{-}\{j\in N:c_j<c_i\}}. For each \eqn{c\in C^N} and each \eqn{i\in N}, the constrained equal contributions rule is defined by
\deqn{
\text{CEC}_i(c)=\text{min}\left\{\dfrac{1}{r-i+1}\left(c_r-\sum\limits_{j\in N^i_{-}}\text{CEC}_j(c)\right):r=1,\dots,n\right\}.
}
This rule offers a different approach to achieving equality.
Contributions are distributed as evenly as possible while ensuring compliance with the no-subsidy constraints.

The contribution selected by the CEC rule for a problem \eqn{c \in C^N} coincides with the payoff vector assigned
by the Dutta-Ray solution (denoted by \eqn{\text{EA}}) to the associated airport game \eqn{v\in G^N}, that is, \eqn{\text{CEC}(c)=\text{EA}(v)}.

\examples{
c <- c(1, 3, 7, 10) # Cost vector
CECrule(c)
