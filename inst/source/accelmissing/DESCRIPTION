Description: We present a statistical method for imputing missing values in accelerometer data. The methodology includes both parametric and semi-parametric multiple imputation under the zero-inflated Poisson lognormal model. It also offers several functions to preprocess accelerometer data before imputation. These include detecting wear and non-wear time, selecting valid days and subjects, and generating plots.
