AB  - Prognosis can no longer be relegated behind diagnosis and therapy in high-quality neurologic care. High-stakes decisions that patients (or their surrogates) make often rest upon perceptions and beliefs about prognosis, many of which are poorly informed. The new science of prognostication-the estimating and communication "what to expect"-is in its infancy and the evidence base to support "best practices" is lacking. We propose a framework for formulating a prediction and communicating "what to expect" with patients, families, and surrogates in the context of common neurologic illnesses. Because neurologic disease affects function as much as survival, we specifically address 2 important prognostic questions: "How long?" and "How well?" We provide a summary of prognostic information and highlight key points when tailoring a prognosis for common neurologic diseases. We discuss the challenges of managing prognostic uncertainty, balancing hope and realism, and ways to effectively engage surrogate decision-makers. We also describe what is known about the nocebo effects and the self-fulfilling prophecy when communicating prognoses. There is an urgent need to establish research and educational priorities to build a credible evidence base to support best practices, improve communication skills, and optimize decision-making. Confronting the challenges of prognosis is necessary to fulfill the promise of delivering high-quality, patient-centered care.

AB  - Behavioral family intervention is an effective form of intervention for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of emotional and behavioral problems in children. There is a growing need to address the accessibility of these services. This paper reviews the literature on self-directed interventions designed to help parents manage difficult child behaviors. Evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions is reviewed, and some of the difficulties associated with self-directed programs are discussed. The Self-directed Triple P and Teen Triple P-Positive Parenting Programs are highlighted as examples of efficacious and effective behavioral family interventions fitting into a larger multilevel model of family intervention. The discussion of the efficacy and effectiveness of self-directed Triple P has implications for service delivery of parenting programs.

AB  - The topic of this study was to evaluate state-dependent effects of diazepam on the frequency characteristics of 47-channel spontaneous EEG maps. A novel method, the FFT-Dipole-Approximation was used to study effects on the strength and the topography of the maps in the different frequency bands. Map topography was characterized by the 3-dimensional location of the equivalent dipole source and map strength was defined as the spatial standard deviation (the Global Field Power) of the maps of each frequency point. The Global Field Power can be considered as a measure of the amount of energy produced by the system, while the source location gives an estimate of the center of gravity of all sources in the brain that were active at a certain frequency. State-dependency was studied by evaluating the drug effects before and after a continuous performance task of 25 min duration. Clear interactions between drug (diazepam vs. placebo) and time after drug intake (before and after the task) were found, especially in the inferior-superior location of the dipole sources. It supports the hypothesis that diazepam, like other drugs, has different effects on brain functions depending on the momentary functional state of the brain. In addition to the drug effects, clearly different source locations and Global Field Power were found for the different frequency bands, replicating earlier reports.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our ongoing longitudinal study has shown that NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power measured at C3 and C4 decrease by more than 60% between ages 11 and 17 years. Here, we investigate the age trajectories of delta and theta power at frontal, central, and occipital electrodes DESIGN: Baseline sleep EEG was recorded twice yearly for 6 years in 2 cohorts, spanning ages 9-18 years, with overlap at 12-15 years SETTING: Sleep EEG was recorded in the subjects' homes with ambulatory recorders PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven subjects in 2 cohorts, one starting at age 9 (n = 30) and one at age 12 years (n = 37) MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep EEG recorded from Fz, Cz, C3, C4, and O1 was referred to mastoids. Visual scoring and artifact elimination was followed by FFT power analysis. Delta and theta EEG power declined steeply across this age range. The maturational trajectories of delta power showed a "back to front" pattern, with O1 delta power declining earliest and Fz delta power declining latest. Theta EEG power did not show this topographic difference in the timing of its decline. Delta, and to a lesser extent, theta power became frontally dominant in early adolescence CONCLUSIONS: We maintain our interpretation that the adolescent decline in EEG power reflects a widespread brain reorganization driven by synaptic pruning. The late decline in frontally recorded delta power indicates that plasticity is maintained in these circuits until a later age. Although delta and theta have similar homeostatic properties, they have different age and topographic patterns that imply different functional correlates STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our ongoing longitudinal study has shown that NREM delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) power measured at C3 and C4 decrease by more than 60% between ages 11 and 17 years.

AB  - Background: Among patients with cancer, the management of depression is very important to improve quality of life as well as distress. Because the efficacy of escitalopram, a potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has not been well evaluated in cancer patients, we investigated its effects on depression and quality of life in outpatients with breast cancer. Methods: A 12-week, open-label, prospective study with escitalopram (5-20 mg/day) was performed in 79 breast cancer outpatients with depression. The primary outcome was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), which was administered at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory (MDASI), Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Distress Thermometer (DT) were also used to measure improvement in symptoms, distress, and quality of life. Results: Compared to baseline, HAMD, DT, and CGI-S scores were significantly decreased at week 1 and onwards, and FACT-B and MDSAI were improved at week 2 and onwards. At the end point (week 12), all FACT-B subscales including the physical, emotional, social/family, functional well-being, and the breast cancer subscales were improved. Improvement in distress and quality of life was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Of all participants, 45.1% met the response criterion (at least a 50% decrease in HAMD total score), and 30.6% met the remission criterion (HAMD total score <= 7) at week 12. Conclusions: In the present study, escitalopram improved quality of life and reduced depression in breast cancer patients. Symptoms rapidly improved within 1 week, influencing quality of life. Escitalopram may be an effective treatment of depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - AIMS: To analyze the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) attended with the mental load arising while solving two cognitive tasks. The features of the presented visual stimulus determined the type of cognitive task that should be solved. METHODS: For each experimental task and everybody's subject FFT Analysis module calculated the total power histograms from a fixed frequency band (3-20 Hz or 8-13 Hz) for each 3-second EEG sample with 50 % overlay and all electrodes. From the histograms the software derived two FFT single values--the average Total Power (TP) and Frequency at Maximum Power (FMP). RESULTS: It has been shown that during the solution of cognitive tasks the marked changes of ongoing EEG activity appeared. The short lasting and localized amplitude decrease in rhythmic activity (ERD) and the change of EEG frequency were among the most frequent. The ERD extent was determined by an informational content of processed visual stimuli and by the site of scalp-recording electrode. A higher mental load related to the solution of cognitive tasks shifted the average FM to lower frequencies. CONCLUSION: The suitability of an analysis of ongoing EEG activity to uncover differences in people's brain activation patterns when engaged in performing cognitively demanding tasks was proved AIMS: To analyze the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) attended with the mental load arising while solving two cognitive tasks.

AB  - New analyses of archival data from a parent training study are presented for ten troubled mother-child dyads. All the mothers participated in verbal discourse sessions with their clinicians during the same weeks in which they participated in clinic-based parent training. The discourse was guided by clinicians to focus mothers on their narratives of parenting problems; five mothers were prompted to restructure their stories in order to improve story coherence, while the other five were simply prompted to continue their stories. All stories were rated for clarity and credibility and mother-child interactions were measured in the dyads' home settings. Results show that the restructuring process led these mothers to tell more credible stories than did the control group mothers. Home observations also showed that the former group followed the parent training protocol, while the latter group did not. In addition, correlations between mothers' narrative credibility scores and home indices of mother-child improvement suggest that the narrative restructuring procedure might have enhanced mothers' parent training performance.

AB  - Spontaneous and provoked changes of vigilance and consciousness are determined by TCS (thalamocortical system) activity. This is relatively easy to monitor using EEG, which is a complex curve but open to analysis, e.g., by means of FFT (fast Fourier transformation). Twenty six persons (six normal controls, twelve epileptics, eight dements) had EEG recorded during rest, reaction to sound, and perception to simple tones or chords from Smetana's symphonic poem Vysehrad. The length of reaction time was found dependent on FFT changes: the longer the time, the higher are the delta and the lower the alpha activities in the EEG spectrum. However, with alpha increasing during relaxation, the reaction time grew longer regardless of whether delta had increased due to hyperventilation, sleep or subclinical epileptic discharges. During the perception of tones, FFT showed changes in the alpha and delta bands different from those during the perception of chords, and different again during relaxation, and that in both normal controls and epileptics. The demented persons revealed no discernible FFT differences in the perception of either tones or chords, the only differences were found in the resting sections of the spectrum. One and the same stimulus produced a stereotype FFT response, i.e., different stimuli elicited different FFT response in healthy and epileptic persons. The dements responded to identical stimuli differently, and had stereotype FFT response elicited by the same stimuli. The results suggest that FFT can represent the information content of the EEG curve and, indirectly, also that of micro-EEG as it reverberates between the thalamus and the cortex in the form of neuronal activity impulsations. This interneuronal impulsation coding is disordered in dements with atrophy of the cortex; it is marked, on the one hand, by increased variability in the perception of identical stimuli, and, on the other hand, by impaired differentiation, and, consequently, by increasingly stereotype responses to different stimuli Spontaneous and provoked changes of vigilance and consciousness are determined by TCS (thalamocortical system) activity.

AB  - Depression during adolescence represents a significant public health concern. It is estimated that up to 20% of adolescents experience an episode of depression that interferes with academic and social functioning and is associated with an increased risk for self harm. Although significant progress has been made in the last decade in treating mental health problems in young people, effective treatment of depression has been harder to demonstrate. In this paper, we describe the application of a promising evidence-based treatment for adult depression, behavioral activation (BA), to the treatment of depressed adolescents. We briefly present the history and overview of the standard BA approach to adult depression and discuss the rationale for the extension of this approach to adolescent depression. We then focus in detail on the process of adapting the treatment to be adolescent-specific by presenting an early client whom we treated without success. The paper closes with a discussion of lessons learned from our experience of treatment failure, including the need to (a) take a more nuanced view of rumination with a focus on shaping brooding into reflective problem. solving, (b) maintain a structured but flexible approach that allows for early introduction of treatment skills most relevant to the individual adolescent, (c) build in careful tracking of suicide risk, and (d) attend to family engagement.

AB  - Data from 1790 HIV-infected and uninfected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were analyzed to evaluate relationships between physical function, incident diabetes mellitus (DM) and insulin resistance among HIV-infected and -uninfected men. DM was defined in two ways, using less stringent and more stringent criteria. The 10-item Physical Functioning Scale from the Short Form-36 Health Survey measured baseline physical function. Cumulative DM incidence was highest among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected men with low physical function. Physical function was a risk factor for DM in HIV-uninfected men and remained so after controlling for BMI, DM family history and race. Among HIV-infected men, physical function was an independent risk factor for DM using the less stringent diabetes definition.

AB  - Flunitrazepam (FNZ) (4mg), an intermediate type benzodiazepine (BDZ) hypnotic, was administered orally to five healthy male subjects (Ss) for seven consecutive nights. Sleep EEG from the baseline night (BLN), the initial drug night (IDN), the fourth and the seventh drug nights (4DN, 7DN) was subjected to fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. During NREM sleep of 4DN and 7DN the sigma band (11.0-12.5 Hz) activity was similarly enhanced in every S. In REM of 4DN and 7DN beta band (23.0-29.0 Hz) was enhanced, but with larger variations among Ss. High intra-individual consistency of the relative EEG power patterns on 4DN and 7DN was observed. These results suggest that 1) EEG responses to FNZ are different in sleep states; explorations of these differences may provide better understandings of sleep mechanisms, and 2) individual variations in EEG responses may reflect individual variations of the BDZ receptor system.

AB  - Background: Experimental and clinical studies postulate a neurobiological mechanism of acupuncture by modulating central pain systems, neurohormones and -transmitters. It seems to be quite likely that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important mediating role in this neuromodulation. Aim: In measuring heart rate variability (HRV), as a non-invasive approach to the ANS-function, the object of this study was to monitor probable acupuncture-induced changes of autonomic balance. The innovative technology of laser-needle acupuncture offers for the first time a stimulation method which fulfils the demands on a placebo-controlled acupuncture trial not requiring controversial sham acupuncture. Method: 19 healthy voluntary subjects underwent 3 treatments in randomized sequence, consisting of placebo-, 1-point- (PC 6) and simultaneous 3-point- (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) laser-needle-stimulation over 20 minutes. Before, during and after placebo-/verum laser-needle acupuncture, HRV-data for normalized HF(high frequency)- and LF(low frequency)-Power (nHF, nLF) and their quotient nLF/nHF obtained by power spectrum analysis (FFT), were measured and analyzed statistically at 5 different time points (ANOVA repeated measures, p < 0,05). Results: During both verum applications, the 1-point- (PC 6) as well as the simultaneous 3-point- (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) laser-needle stimulation, significant changes of the ANS-activity were found in comparison to the placebo application. The most significant modification of HRV was an increase of nHF (p < 0,05 (PC 6), p < 0,0001 (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3)) as an expression of growing vagal activity during acupuncture. Conclusion: Laser-needle acupuncture causes in 1-point-stimulation (PC 6) as well as in simultaneous 3-point-stimulation (PC 6, LR 3, SI 3) significant changes in HRV in comparison to placebo application. HRV-monitoring seems to be a suitable approach in exploration of acupuncture-induced changes of ANS and could possibly be established in combination with laser needle acupuncture as a standard for further scientific and clinical acupuncture investigations which are greatly needed Background: Experimental and clinical studies postulate a neurobiological mechanism of acupuncture by modulating central pain systems, neurohormones and -transmitters.

AB  - Tremor is frequently encountered in neurologic practice. Clinical examination supplies information regarding its approximative frequency, regularity, amplitude, topography and activation conditions. The neurophysiological study helps in confirming the tremor, in differentiating it from other movement disorders like myoclonus, and may provide distinctive features which are important for the aetiological diagnosis. The neurophysiological investigation includes accelerometry, which analyses the mechanics of the movement. Spectral analysis with FFT allows the determination of frequency and amplitude. Accelerometry is always associated with surface EMG of at least two antagonistic muscles. It may show rhythmic bursts, their frequency, duration and activation pattern (alternating or synchronous). This neurophysiological approach to tremor has multiple interests. It may help in differentiating a true rest tremor from a postural tremor seemingly persisting at rest. Brief interruptions or rhythm breaks during distraction manoeuvers are seen in psychogenic tremors. Surface EMG may also demonstrate positive myoclonic bursts, or brief silent periods corresponding to negative myoclonus, sometimes pseudorhythmic, thus appearing clinically like a tremor, but investigations, aetiologies and treatment are different. Several features, especially slow frequency, may suggest a midbrain tremor, thus requiring brain imagery centered around the posterior fossa. Finally, the neurophysiological examination is the only way to demonstrate a primary writing tremor, or a primary orthostatic tremor, the frequency of which is pathognomonic while clinical symptoms are rather misleading.

AB  - This paper argues for the importance of adopting a population-level approach to promote more effective parenting and to reduce the risk of child maltreatment. Family-based interventions based on social learning principles have been shown to make a useful contribution in the treatment of child maltreatment. However, typically such programmes have been used to treat parents who have already become involved in the child protection system. We argue that the creation of community-wide support structures to support positive parenting is needed to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment. Such an approach requires several criteria to be met. These include having knowledge about the prevalence rates for the targeted child outcomes sought, knowledge about the prevalence of various parenting and family risk factors, evidence that changing family risk factors reduces the prevalence of targeted problems, having culturally appropriate, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions available and making these widely accessible.

AB  - This paper presents the development of structural dynamic equations of motion for a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible intermediate links, based on the assumed mode method. Lagrange's equation is used to derive the dynamic model of the manipulator system. Flexible intermediate links are modeled as Euler--Bernoulli beams with pinned--pinned boundary conditions. Dynamic equations of motion of a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible links are developed by adopting the assumed mode method. The effect of concentrated rotational inertia at both ends of intermediate links is included in this model. Numerical simulations of vibration responses, coupling forces and inertial forces are presented. The corresponding frequency spectra analysis is performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental modal tests are performed to validate the theoretical model through comparison and analysis of modal characteristics of the flexible manipulator system.

AB  - We evaluated the potential for using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis applied to a standard ventilator waveform to estimate (< 2 Hz) frequency dependence of respiratory or lung resistance (R) and elastance (E). In four healthy humans we measured pressure and flow at the airway opening while applying sine wave forcing from 0.2 to 0.6 Hz at two tidal volumes (VT; 250 and 500 ml). We then applied a step inspiratory ventilator flow wave with relaxed expiration at the same VT and only 0.2 Hz. Step waveform data were also acquired from nine mechanically ventilated patients under intensive care unit conditions. Finally, we simultaneously measured total respiratory (rs), lung (L), and chest wall (cw) impedance data from two dogs (0.156-2 Hz) before and after severe pulmonary edema. Rrs and Ers were estimated by the FFT approach. Humans displayed a small frequency dependence in Rrs and Ers from 0.2 to 0.6 Hz, and both Rrs and Ers decreased at the higher VT. The spectral estimates of Rrs and Ers with the step ventilator wave were often qualitatively comparable to sine wave results below 0.6 Hz but became extremely erratic above the third harmonic. Conversely, in dogs the step wave produced reliable and stable estimates up to 2 Hz in all conditions. Nevertheless, Ecw and Ers still displayed clear and correlated oscillations with increasing frequency, whereas EL showed none. This suggests that nonlinear processes, most likely at the chest wall, contribute to periodic-like fluctuations in respiratory mechanical properties when estimated by applying FFT to a step ventilator wave. Moreover, in humans, but not dogs, a ventilator flow cycle contains insufficient signal energy beyond the third harmonic. We show that the amount of energy available at higher frequencies is largely governed by the mechanical time constant contributing to passive expiratory flow. In dogs the shorter time constant contributes to increased energy. In essence, the frequency content of the flow is subject dependent, and this is not a desirable situation for controlling the quality of the impedance spectra available from a standard ventilator wave We evaluated the potential for using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis applied to a standard ventilator waveform to estimate (< 2 Hz) frequency dependence of respiratory or lung resistance (R) and elastance (E).

AB  - Background Psychological therapies have been developed for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. Such therapies include parent only or parent and child/adolescent, and are designed to treat parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and/or family functioning. No comprehensive, meta-analytic reviews have been published in this area. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological therapies that include coping strategies for parents of children/adolescents with chronic illnesses (painful conditions, cancer, diabetes mellitus, asthma, traumatic brain injury, inflammatory bowel diseases, skin diseases or gynaecological disorders). The therapy will aim to improve parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and family functioning. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions that included parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness. The initial search was from inception of these databases to June 2011 and we conducted a follow-up search from June 2011 to March 2012. We identified additional studies from the reference list of retrieved papers and from discussion with investigators. Selection criteria Included studies were RCTs of psychological interventions that delivered treatment to parents of children and adolescents (under 19 years of age) with a chronic illness compared to active control, wait list control or treatment as usual. We excluded studies if the parent component was a coaching intervention, the aim of the intervention was health prevention/promotion, the comparator was a pharmacological treatment, the child/adolescent had an illness not listed above or the study included children with more than one type of chronic illness. Further to this, we excluded studies when the sample size of either comparator group was fewer than 10 at post-treatment. Data collection and analysis We included 35 RCTs involving a total of 2723 primary trial participants. Two review authors extracted data from 26 studies. We analysed data using two categories. First, we analysed data by each medical condition across all treatment classes at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). Second, we analysed data by each treatment class (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy (FT), problem solving therapy (PST) and multisystemic therapy (MST)) across all medical conditions at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). We assessed treatment effectiveness on six possible outcomes: parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and family functioning. Main results Across all treatment types, psychological therapies that included parents significantly improved child symptoms for painful conditions immediately post-treatment. Across all medical conditions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) significantly improved child symptoms and problem solving therapy significantly improved parent behaviour and parent mental health immediately post-treatment. There were no other effects at post-treatment or follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies is described. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence on the effectiveness of psychological therapies that include parents in most outcome domains of functioning, for a large number of common chronic illnesses in children. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of including parents in psychological therapies that reduce pain in children with painful conditions. There is also good evidence for the effectiveness of CBT that includes parents for improving the primary symptom complaints when available data were included from chronic illness conditions. Finally, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of problem solving therapy delivered to parents on improving parent problem solving skills and parent mental health. All effects are immediately post-treatment. There are no significant findings for any treatment effects in any condition at follow-up Background Psychological therapies have been developed for parents of children and adolescents with a chronic illness.

Data collection and analysis We included 35 RCTs involving a total of 2723 primary trial participants. Two review authors extracted data from 26 studies. We analysed data using two categories. First, we analysed data by each medical condition across all treatment classes at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). Second, we analysed data by each treatment class (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy (FT), problem solving therapy (PST) and multisystemic therapy (MST)) across all medical conditions at two time points (immediately post-treatment and the first available follow-up). We assessed treatment effectiveness on six possible outcomes: parent behaviour, parent mental health, child behaviour/disability, child mental health, child symptoms and family functioning. Main results Across all treatment types, psychological therapies that included parents significantly improved child symptoms for painful conditions immediately post-treatment. Across all medical conditions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) significantly improved child symptoms and problem solving therapy significantly improved parent behaviour and parent mental health immediately post-treatment. There were no other effects at post-treatment or follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies is described. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence on the effectiveness of psychological therapies that include parents in most outcome domains of functioning, for a large number of common chronic illnesses in children. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of including parents in psychological therapies that reduce pain in children with painful conditions. There is also good evidence for the effectiveness of CBT that includes parents for improving the primary symptom complaints when available data were included from chronic illness conditions. Finally, there is good evidence for the effectiveness of problem solving therapy delivered to parents on improving parent problem solving skills and parent mental health. All effects are immediately post-treatment. There are no significant findings for any treatment effects in any condition at follow-up

AB  - Child maltreatment is associated with serious psychosocial difficulties and enormous direct and indirect societal costs. As such, it is an area for which new and promising interventions are highly important. The purpose of this exploratory research is to examine intensive school-based psychodynamic therapy for severely maltreated children experiencing significant difficulties, by obtaining perceptions of therapeutic effectiveness by the children's parents, teachers and therapists. Themes include: therapists', parents', and teachers' perceptions of child's changes; parental perceptions of therapy and relationship with the therapist; therapists' perception of relationship with parents; school as the location of therapy; teacher-therapist relationship; and the child's academic status. doi:10.1300/J032v14n02_03 [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER] Copyright of Psychoanalytic Social Work is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

METHOD: Fifty-four cases were included. The diagnosis was made by polysomnography (PSG). C3/A2 was analyzed by using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Spectral edge frequency (SEF), median power frequency (MPF). a-index, beta-index, delta-index and theta-index were compared with those peri-UPPP treatment. RESULT: Sleep architecture was improved after UPPP. The ratio of slow wave sleep increased. A decrease of mean SEF in total sleep period. The mean MPF was decreased during stage IV. a-index and beta-index were decreased, delta-index and theta-index were increased after the therapy. CONCLUSION: The UPPP therapy has an acute effect in improving the sleep architecture and EEG power spectrum. These changes may be related to the recovery of cerebral function in patients with OSAHS OBJECTIVE: To study the peri-uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) effects on EEG spectral power changes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS).

Therapists can use the SPFF to understand and integrate existing models of family therapy and to create their own personal models of family therapy. The SPFF framework highlights the interrelationships among the four generic models which dominate the field of family therapy. Personal models of family therapy are based on maps of family functioning derived from one of these more generic models.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the identities of eight women who share similar demographic profiles but exhibit different language practices. These middle-aged and older women belong to two social groups which, we argue, constitute two communities of practice within a small black Appalachian community in the Southern United States. From interview data, we analyze six diagnostic sociolinguistic variables (third singular -s absence, copula absence, rhoticity, consonant cluster reduction, habitual be) and also examine productions of /u/ and /o/. The groups differ significantly in their use of the morphosyntactic and syntactic variables and in their vowel productions, but not the consonantal features. Combining our quantitative findings with qualitative data, we suggest language is one of several vehicles the women use to transmit symbolic messages to others and thereby construct identities for themselves and their groups, whose members adhere to different language ideologies, religious norms, notions of feminine decorum, and educational standards.

AB  - Relative to the United States and other western countries, less research has focused on factors associated with caregiving burden and maternal pessimism in Taiwanese mothers of adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The characteristics of 50 adolescents with an ASD living at home in Taiwan and its association with caregiving burden and maternal pessimism were examined. The age range of adolescents with an ASD was from 10 to 18. Mothers, aged 35 to 55 years, completed self-report written questionnaires regarding their child's adaptive functioning and their own perceptions of caregiving burdens and concerns. Findings indicated that functional independence, severe maladaptive behaviours and severity of autism were predictive of maternal caregiving burden. Maternal pessimism was associated with functional independence and severity of autism. The findings of this study indicated that occupational therapy practitioners could focus on training functional independence of the individual with an ASD to meet the family's need in Taiwan. Researchers should pay significant attention to the lifespan issues of autism in Taiwanese families. The major limitations of this study were small sample size and without a comparison group. Future research using larger samples with a comparison group is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The signal-averaged ECG has been used to detect late potentials, and it is considered a noninvasive marker for areas of slow conduction requisite for reentrant arrhythmia. Late potentials are not usually found in patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT); nevertheless, fragmented electrograms are often recorded in those patients during endocardial mapping. The purpose of this study was to investigate the spectral content of the signal-averaged ECGs with use of fast Fourier transform analysis (FFT) in patients with idiopathic VT of left ventricular origin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Signal-averaged ECGs were recorded in 12 patients with idiopathic VT originating from the left ventricle (group 1) and 25 age-matched normal volunteers (group 2). Frequency analysis with FFT was performed with a Blackman-Harris window in a segment length of 120 msec from 40 msec before the end of the QRS complex, and the frequency spectrum was displayed in a three-dimensional graph. Area ratio 1 (area of 20-50 Hz/area of 10-50 Hz) and area ratio 2 (area of 40-100 Hz/area of 0-40 Hz) were calculated in all subjects. Late potentials defined by the time domain were negative in all subjects. The area ratios of group 1 were significantly higher than those of group 2. High-frequency components in the three-dimensional graph were confined within the QRS complex. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that frequency analysis of signal-averaged ECGs with FFT is an available method for detecting the high-frequency component within the QRS complex in some patients with idiopathic VT of left ventricular origin BACKGROUND: The signal-averaged ECG has been used to detect late potentials, and it is considered a noninvasive marker for areas of slow conduction requisite for reentrant arrhythmia.

AB  - A major cause of the well-documented inadequacy of pain treatment is the in ability to assess pain. Current pain quantification relies on patient reporting which is subjective, inconsistent and even impossible in many patient populations. The purpose of this project is to apply feature extraction to Electroencephalograph (EEG) in efforts to elucidate data that is highly correlated with pain state towards the future development of a pattern recognition system for pain quantification. EEG data was collected from human subjects during Cold Pressor (CP) pain, an Arithmetic Control (AC), Pain Anticipation (PA) control and a muscle artifact control (WINCE). Feature extraction techniques were investigated via scalp topographies verified with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Frequency-based features included Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mean-Frequency. Alpha1/2 had an artifact-free temporo-parietal decrease contralateral to stimulus with pain suggesting pain related activation of the parietal operculum/insula and occipital increase likely due to decreased visual activity. The Theta band had a fronto-central decrease that could indicate either a pain-related activation of the anterior cingulate cortex or a pain-irrelevant change in working memory load. The mean-frequency feature showed a generalized increase with pain but will result from non-pain conditions as well. Gamma-1 and Beta-2 wavelet variability showed a decrease in some regions with pain, however these changes appear to due to muscle artifact. Alpha-1/2 and Theta bands showed an artifact-free contralateral-temporal increase in CP-control which shows promise as a pain metric. Several complexity based features were investigated as well. ARMO showed an artifact free decrease for with pain in frontal and occipital. SE using FFT showed an increase in CP-controls for all electrodes while WINCE-controls had a global decrease. ApEn also resulted in an increase in CP-controls for all electrodes, but some muscle artifact. AutoRegressive Models were computed for orders 1<ef><bf><bd>_"25 and 50 with the <ef><bf><bd>_~a<ef><bf><bd>_T values of each order being considered as features. Visual inspection of these <ef><bf><bd>_~a<ef><bf><bd>_T values show a variety of topographies with either high correlation between pain and wince comparisons or topographies with generalized results. AR appears to show little promise as a pain metric, but will be useful as a muscle artifact detector.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between clinician-reported content addressed in sessions, measured with the Session Report Form (SRF), and multi-informant problem alerts stemming from a larger battery of treatment process and progress measures. Multilevel Multinomial Logit Models were conducted with 133 clinicians and 299 youths receiving home-based treatment (N = 3,143 sessions). Results indicate a strong relationship between session content and problems related to youth symptoms and functioning as reported by clinicians in the same session. Session content was related to emotional, family, and friend/peer problems reported by youth and youth behavioral problems reported by caregivers. High-risk problems (alcohol/substance use, harm to self or others) were strongly related to session content regardless of informant. Session content was not related to problem alerts associated with the treatment process, caregiver strain, or client/caregiver strengths. The SRF appears to be a useful measure for assessing common themes addressed in routine mental health settings This study explores the relationship between clinician-reported content addressed in sessions, measured with the Session Report Form (SRF), and multi-informant problem alerts stemming from a larger battery of treatment process and progress measures. Multilevel Multinomial Logit Models were conducted with 133 clinicians and 299 youths receiving home-based treatment (N = 3,143 sessions). Results indicate a strong relationship between session content and problems related to youth symptoms and functioning as reported by clinicians in the same session.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether diabetic patients who were depressed present a decrease of brain serotonergic activity compared to diabetic patients without depression or patients with depression but without diabetes. Determination was made with plasma free fraction of l-tryptophan (FFT) and intensity-dependent auditoryevoked potentials (IDAEPs). Methods: Thirty seven adolescents were studied (20 type 1 diabetic subjects: 9 with depression, 11 without depression), 9 controls and 8 subjects with only depression. FFT, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, free fatty acids, albumin and IDAEPs were determined. Result: All diabetic patients showed a significant decrease of FFT. The group diabetic subjects with depression presented a steeper slope of the amplitude-intensity function of N1/P2 component, suggesting a higher reactivity of the auditory cortex in comparison to diabetic subjects without depression, subjects with only depression, and controls. This was associated with lower plasma FFT. Diabetic subjects with depression had a deficiency of metabolic control due to poor treatment adherence. Conclusions: These findings suggest an enhanced deterioration of brain serotonergic neurotransmission in diabetic subjects with depression with abnormal responses of the auditory cortex. The N1/P2 component of IDAEP is proposed as a noninvasive indicator of brain serotonergic tone that differentiates depressed from nondepressed diabetic patients Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether diabetic patients who were depressed present a decrease of brain serotonergic activity compared to diabetic patients without depression or patients with depression but without diabetes.

AB  - Purpose: Optimizing home and community participation of children with physical disabilities is an important outcome of rehabilitation. Method: A review of literature identified research and theory on participation of children with physical disabilities. The authors' incorporated current knowledge to conceptualize the experience of optimal participation, formulate principles of participation-based physical and occupational therapy, and develop a five-step process for intervention. A case report was completed to illustrate application to practice. Results: Optimal participation involves the dynamic interaction of determinants (attributes of the child, family, and environment) and dimensions (physical, social, and self engagement) of participation. Real-life experiences enable children to learn new activities and develop skills that optimize their participation and self-determination. Interventions are: goal-oriented, family-centered, collaborative, strengths-based, ecological, and self-determined. A distinguishing feature of intervention is that the therapist's primary role is to support the child and family to identify challenges to participation and solutions to challenges. The therapist is a consultant, collaborating with the child, family, and community providers to share information, educate, and instruct in ways that build child, family, and community capacity. Conclusion: The model may have utility for collaboration with families and community providers, determining goals for participation, and providing evidence-informed interventions Purpose: Optimizing home and community participation of children with physical disabilities is an important outcome of rehabilitation.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated that the family members of adolescents with mental diseases experience distress, anxiety and depression, as well as economic strain, all of which contribute to physical and psychological caregiver morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of intervention to improve the caregiving experience of the parents of mentally ill adolescents. The parents of 20 patients were assessed with the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI) and the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI), while patients' functioning and psychopathology were evaluated with the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), respectively. Assessments were conducted over 9 months, comparing the experimental group receiving the intervention with a control group that received "standard'' care. While there were no significant differences in the patients' psychopathologies, the caregivers in the experimental group had better ECI and WAI scores. Intervention focusing on the parents seemed to improve the caregivers' understanding of the disease's impact on their lives irrespective of the severity of their children's condition. This finding may be useful in developing adequate measures for the parents of adolescents with severe mental diseases to help contain their psychological distress Several studies have demonstrated that the family members of adolescents with mental diseases experience distress, anxiety and depression, as well as economic strain, all of which contribute to physical and psychological caregiver morbidity.

AB  - Introduction.- Sustained attention is a fundamental executive function. Previous evidence suggests frail older people perform poorly on tasks that place a higher demand on resources of attention. We investigated whether increasing sustained attention variabilitywas associated with frailty in a population representative sample of adults aged>=50 years using the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Text.- Four thousand seven hundred and eighty-five participants of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) completed a comprehensive health assessment. Frailty was defined by having>= 3 of low gait speed, low grip strength, unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion and low physical activity. Mean and variability of reaction time (RT), commission and omission errors were recorded during a fixed-SART. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) procedurewasused to characterise variability associated with the arousal and vigilance aspects of sustained attention. Among the Irish population>=50 years of age, 3.7% were frail and 35.3% were pre-frail. Non-frail participants had significantly less RT variability (P < 0.001), and fewer commission (P < 0.001) and omission (P < 0.001) errors than their pre-frail and frail counterparts. Regression analyses, adjusted for age and gender, revealed variability associated with the vigilance aspect of sustained attention was strongly associated with pre-frailty (P < 0.001: OR= 1.10, 95% CI: 1.06-1.15) and frailty (P < 0.001: OR= 1.21, 95% CI: 1.13-1.30). Variability associated with the arousal aspect also increased the risk of pre-frailty (p < 0.05: OR= 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) and frailty (P < 0.05: OR= 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13).

AB  - In recent years, there has been much discussion of the efficacy of mental health interventions for children as well as the transportation of empirically-supported treatments (ESTs) to field settings. A logical initial step in this line of research is to examine whether the efficacy of ESTs can be demonstrated in community settings such as in the home environment. The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy of an in-home Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) program using a single-subject, A/B design across five subjects with staggered baselines. Decreases in caregiver use of negative behavior and caregiver-reported child behavior problems were observed for the three families that completed treatment. In addition, completers demonstrated increases in child compliance, caregiver use of positive behavior, and contingent praise. Data regarding caregivers' reported parenting stress and caregiver proportion of direct commands were less convincing. All three dyads completing treatment reported satisfaction with the intervention. Clinical implications regarding the possible benefits of PCIT for improving the effectiveness of home visiting programs are discussed as well as directions for future research.

AB  - Comments on an article by DJ Miklowitz et al. (see record 2008-18377-007). the authors present results of a 2-year randomized trial on family-focused treatment for adolescents with bipolar disorder (FFT-A). They conclude that FFT-A is effective in stabilizing bipolar depressive symptoms among adolescents. Unfortunately, however, the report lacks important information necessary to assess the actual efficacy of the intervention because Miklowitz et al. did not report the exact number of subjects per group who entered the study in a syndromally depressed state. Accordingly, recovery rates from initial depressive symptoms should correspond to the subgroups of patients who entered the study syndromally depressed and not to the total number of subjects per group. Finally, Miklowitz et al. colleagues failed to report a significance test for the group difference in depression-free weeks for the sub-sample of patients entering the study in a syndromally depressed state. Delineation of this information is important, particularly because of the overall small sample sizes in this study.

AB  - Since EEG is one of the most important sources of information in therapy of epilepsy, several researchers tried to address the issue of decision support for such a data. In this paper, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Logistic regression as well as feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used FFT and autoregressive (AR) model by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or nonepileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying AR with MLE in connection with WNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The network is constructed by the error backpropagation neural network using Morlet mother wavelet basic function as node activation function. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN and logistic regression based counterpart. Within the same group, the WNN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier, and the logistic regression-based classifier Since EEG is one of the most important sources of information in therapy of epilepsy, several researchers tried to address the issue of decision support for such a data. In this paper, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Logistic regression as well as feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used FFT and autoregressive (AR) model by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or nonepileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying AR with MLE in connection with WNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture.

TI  - Effect of intravenous drug administration mode on drug distribution in a tumor slab: a finite Fourier transform analysis

AB  - Cancer therapy using chemotherapeutic drugs frequently involves injection of the drug into the body through some intravenous mode of administration, viz, continuous (drip) infusion or single/multiple bolus injection(s). An understanding of the effect of the various modes of administration upon tumor penetration of drug is essential to rational design of drug therapy. This paper investigates drug penetration into a model tumor of slab geometry (between two capillaries) in which the overall transport rate of drug is limited by intra-tumor transport characterized by an effective diffusion coefficient. Employing the method of Finite Fourier Transforms (FFT), analytical solutions have been obtained for transient drug distribution in both the plasma and the tumor following three modes of administration, viz, continuous infusion, single bolus injection and equally-spaced equal-dose multiple bolus injections, of a given amount of drug. The qualitative trends exhibited by the plasma drug distribution profiles are consistent with reported experimental studies. Two concepts, viz, the dimensionless decay constant and the plasma/tumor drug concentration trajectories, are found to be particularly useful in the rational design of drug therapy. The dimensionless decay constant provides a measure of the rate of drug decay in the plasma relative to the rate of drug diffusion into the tumor and is thus characteristic of the tumor/drug system. The magnitude of this parameter dictates the choice of drug administration mode for minimizing drug decay in the plasma while simultaneously maximizing drug transport into the tumor. The concentration trajectories provide a measure of the plasma drug concentration relative to the tumor drug concentration at various times following injection. When the tumor drug concentration exceeds the plasma drug concentration, the drug will begin to diffuse out of the tumor. Knowledge of the time at which this diffusion reversal occurs is especially useful for optimum scheduling of subsequent bolus injections in a multiple bolus dosing regimen. There are no reported applications of the FFT method to solve repeated input functions in either the chemical engineering or pharmaceutical science literature. Thus, the application of FFT method to solve multiple bolus injections is a unique one. Use of this FFT based analysis as a predictor tool can limit the number of costly experiments which are being done now to achieve this purpose. Even though the model in its present form is simplified, the analysis thereof has nevertheless led to a better understanding of the various factors that must be taken into account for rational design of drug therapy Cancer therapy using chemotherapeutic drugs frequently involves injection of the drug into the body through some intravenous mode of administration, viz, continuous (drip) infusion or single/multiple bolus injection(s).

The data of this group were compared with those from two other diagnostic groups (affective disorders, n = 318; conduct disorders, n = 982) who were treated as inpatients at the same time. Schizophrenic patients were significantly older at admittance (mean 17.6 years) than patients in the other two diagnostic groups (affective disorders 15.9 years, conduct disorders 13.1 years). On average,the inpatient treatment stay was longer in schizophrenic patients (by approximately I month) than in both of the other groups,and dropout was less frequent (5% vs 9% in affective disorders and 11% in conduct disorders).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To improve the diagnostic power of high resolution electrocardiography for discriminating patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, new methods based on spectral analysis have been used in recent years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods for predicting the risk of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in patients after myocardial infarction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: High resolution ECG were recorded in 129 post-infarction patients and 23 healthy volunteers. Of the post-infarction patients: 62 presented with ventricular tachycardia, 23 with ventricular fibrillation, while 44 had no clinically relevant arrhythmias. The ECG signals were recorded in three orthogonal X, Y, Z leads and averaged using cross-correlation method. Spectral analysis was performed by fast Fourier transform and the parametric modeling method with autoregressive model. Spectral analysis data were evaluated quantitatively by computing normality factor for FFT and spectral factor for AR. RESULTS: Both methods were found to be useful for evaluating the risk of arrhythmias. The sensitivity of ventricular tachycardia risk evaluation was higher (81%--FFT, 73%--AR) than that of evaluating the risk of ventricular fibrillation (30%--FFT, 48%--AR). The specificity in post-infarction patients without arrhythmias (93%--FFT, 84%--AR) was as high as that in healthy subjects (96%--FFT, 87%--AR). CONCLUSIONS: Spectral analysis of HRECG is an effective method for evaluating the risk of VT and VF in patients after myocardial infarction INTRODUCTION: To improve the diagnostic power of high resolution electrocardiography for discriminating patients at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, new methods based on spectral analysis have been used in recent years.

AB  - The incidence of stroke is high in Brazil and in the whole world. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular autonomic modulation of chronic ischemic stroke patients. Seventeen men and women separated in stroke (SG; n=10; 56+/-2years old; 164+/-2cm height; 68+/-3kg weight) and control group (CG; n=7; 51 +/-5years old; 168+/-1cm height; 64+/-4kg weight) were evaluated. The SG group (5+/-1years after stroke) was under pharmacological treatment (ACE inhibitor, simvastatin and acetylsalicylic acid). Blood pressure (BP) was recorded continuously (Finometer) during 15 minutes. The heart rate variability (HRV)and the BP variability were analyzed in time and frequency domains (FFT). The SG presented similar systolic (SBP: 123+/-6 vs. 110+/-3 mmHg) and diastolic BP(DBP: 82 +/-6 vs. 75+/-1 mmHg) as well as heart rate (72 +/-5 vs. 70+/-3bpm) as compared to CG. The RR variance (544+/-197 vs. 1714+/-232 ms<sup>2</sup>) was decreased in SG as compared to CG. SBP variance (57+/-13 vs. 22+/-6 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) and LF of SBP (6.8+/-1.4 vs. 2.8+/-0.8 mmHg<sup>2</sup>) were increased in SG as compared to CG.

AB  - Background: During the process of implantation, parents may have rather heterogeneous expectations and concerns about their child's development and the functioning of habilitation and education services. Their views on habilitation and education are important for building family-centred practices. Aims: We explored the perceptions of parents and speech and language therapists (SLTs) on the effects of implantation on the child and the family and on the quality of services provided. Their views were also compared. Methods & Procedures: Parents and SLTs of 18 children filled out questionnaires containing open-and closed-ended questions at 6 months and annually 1-5 years after activation of the implant. Their responses were analysed mainly using data-based inductive content analysis. Outcomes & Results: Positive experiences outnumbered negative ones in the responses of both the parents and the SLTs surveyed. The parents were particularly satisfied with the improvement in communication and expanded social life in the family. These were the most prevalent themes also raised by the SLTs. The parents were also satisfied with the organization and content of habilitation. Most of the negative experiences were related to arrangement of hospital visits and the usability and maintenance of speech processor technology. Some children did not receive enough speech and language therapy, and some of the parents were dissatisfied with educational services. The habilitation process had generally required parental efforts at an expected level. However, parents with a child with at least one concomitant problem experienced habilitation as more stressful than did other parents. Conclusions & Implications: Parents and SLTs had more positive than negative experiences with implantation. As the usability and maintenance of speech processor technology were often compromised, we urge implant centres to ensure sufficient personnel for technical maintenance. It is also important to promote services by providing enough information and parental support Background: During the process of implantation, parents may have rather heterogeneous expectations and concerns about their child's development and the functioning of habilitation and education services.

In this algorithm, users are divided into different groups belonging to different quantized channel regions, and then the active user group is selected by semi-orthogonal property among the channel regions. Simulation results show that the presented algorithm can get higher sum rates than SUS and it can greatly reduced the computing complexity when the number of users is large at the same time. It can be conduded that the new algorithm is beneficial in terms of increasing the system throughput as well as decreasing the complexity of multiuser scheduling.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of a constant-Q spectrogram representation that is invertible in a least-squares sense. A good quality inverse is possible because this modified transform method, unlike the usual sliding window constant-Q spectrogram, does not discard data samples when performing the variable length discrete Fourier transforms on the signal. The development of a phase vocoder application using this modified technique is also discussed. It is shown that a phase vocoder constructed using the least-squares invertible constant-Q spectrogram (LSICQS) is not a trivial extension of the regular FFT-based phase vocoder algorithm and some of the mathematical subtleties related to phase reassignment are addressed This paper discusses the development of a constant-Q spectrogram representation that is invertible in a least-squares sense.

AB  - An MRI simulation method, together with a corresponding computer program, using the k-space formalism has been developed. It uses a FFT algorithm to generate the ideal NMR signal from a user defined object. The k-space trajectory given by a pulse sequence is calculated. And it is used to select elements from the ideal NMR signal. This selection of elements mimic the sampling of the signal in an actual MRI experiment. During the sampling procedure changes in signal amplitude due to relaxation and excitation are introduced as well as signal phase changes due to movement or flow. Artifacts due to stimulated echoes and transversal magnetization that propagate through several repetition periods are also handled. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by calculations using standard spin-echo sequence as well as modifications introduced in order to generate angiographical images and flow phase images. Further more a fast pulse sequence, echo planar imaging (EPI), is also simulated. The method is faster than previously presented ones. It is capable of generating images (128 x 128 matrix), including more than eight different T1 and T2 combinations, in less than 3 min on a standard 386/387 type IBM compatible PC An MRI simulation method, together with a corresponding computer program, using the k-space formalism has been developed.

During the sampling procedure changes in signal amplitude due to relaxation and excitation are introduced as well as signal phase changes due to movement or flow. Artifacts due to stimulated echoes and transversal magnetization that propagate through several repetition periods are also handled. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by calculations using standard spin-echo sequence as well as modifications introduced in order to generate angiographical images and flow phase images. Further more a fast pulse sequence, echo planar imaging (EPI), is also simulated. The method is faster than previously presented ones. It is capable of generating images (128 x 128 matrix), including more than eight different T1 and T2 combinations, in less than 3 min on a standard 386/387 type IBM compatible PC

AB  - The article presents a perspective on the effort in developing a therapeutic relationship with persons suffering from eating disorder in Shenzhen, China. It has been noted that in working with the Shenzhen youths with eating disorder, the therapist's admission of her limited knowledge of the Shenzhen culture, its social norms and behaviours, the spoken dialects, and her readiness to learn more in these areas is extremely crucial. A pluralist orientation and a respect for cultural diversity are fundamental for a Hong Kong family therapist to acquire more complex accommodating strategies in intra-cultural practice The article presents a perspective on the effort in developing a therapeutic relationship with persons suffering from eating disorder in Shenzhen, China.

AB  - Loss of body fat and lean body mass are features of critical illness, and anabolism is difficult to achieve despite parenteral nutrition. Resting energy expenditure (REE), free fatty acid turnover (FFT) and glycerol turnover (glyTO) were measured in septic, mechanically ventilated cancer-bearing patients, both fasting and immediately following or during a glucose infusion providing 87% of REE. No patient was in septic shock nor required pressor support. In the fasting state, REE was greatly elevated compared with basal energy expenditure calculated using the Harris-Benedict equations. Fasting FFT (14.2 +/- 0.9 mumol/kg/min) and glyTO (4.7 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg/min) were elevated compared with normal humans. Fasting respiratory quotient (RQ) was 0.68 +/- 0.02 and did not rise significantly with glucose.

AB  - We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study to explore the relationship of suicidal ideation, mental health problems, and social functioning to acne severity among adolescents aged 18-19 years. A total of 4,744 youth were invited and 3,775 (80%) participated. In all, 14% reported having substantial acne (a lot and very much). Among those with very much acne, as compared those with no/little acne, suicidal ideation was twice as frequently reported among girls (25.5 vs. 11.9%) and three times more frequently reported among boys (22.6 vs. 6.3%). Suicidal ideation remained significantly associated with substantial acne (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.30-2.50) in a multivariate model including adjustments of symptoms of depression, ethnicity, and family income. Mental health problems, as assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (2.25, 1.69-3.00), low attachment to friends (1.52, 1.21-1.91), not thriving at school (1.41, 1.12-1.78), never having had a romantic relationship (1.35, 1.05-1.70), and never having had sexual intercourse (1.51, 1.21-1.89) were all associated with substantial acne in a multivariate model. Acne is frequently found in late adolescence and is associated with social and psychological problems.

AB  - This study investigated social skills deficits among adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 18) as compared with a control group of adolescents (n = 18) free from major psychiatric disturbance. We hypothesized that symptom-free bipolar adolescents would be indistinguishable from controls on ratings of social skills knowledge, but would exhibit significant social skills performance deficits relative to controls. Axis I diagnoses for bipolar patients were determined via the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) during recruitment for a pilot study of Family-Focused Therapy for Adolescents (FFT-A), a modified version of Miklowitz & Goldstein's (1997) family-focused intervention for adults with bipolar disorder. Bipolar participants completed social skills assessments when they were experiencing minimal symptoms. The control group consisted of individuals who responded to advertisements requesting participation from teens not diagnosed with psychological disturbance. These teens were subsequently screened for psychopathology using the K-SADS-PL. To assess social skills performance assets and deficits, participants completed the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY), a self-report scale that requires subjects to rate the frequency of various prosocial behaviors. The teen's parent or guardian simultaneously completed the T-MESSY (teacher/parent rated version). Knowledge of appropriate social skills was measured using the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategy Interview (INS), a structured interview that asks participants to formulate solutions to hypothetical social dilemmas. Raters blind to psychiatric condition rated the participant's responses, as well as his/her social interactions with the examiner during the assessment using the Interactional Skills Ratings (ISR) scale. In line with our hypotheses, bipolar adolescents exhibited age-appropriate knowledge of social skills during a period of symptom remission, but displayed more social skills performance deficits on both self- and parent-rated assessments than controls. Bipolar participants were indistinguishable from controls on blinded ratings of interactions with the examiner. Implications of the findings for biological models of the onset of bipolar disorder, and psychosocial interventions are discussed.

AB  - Obturator prostheses have been extensively used in the functional rehabilitation of maxillectomy patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro the vibration movements of three types of obturator prostheses. Three types of bulbs were used: the solid type, the buccal flange type, and the hollow type. Modal analysis was performed to identify the better form. The three types of obturator prostheses were excited by a shaker, and the frequency response functions were recorded on an FFT analyzer to identify their modal shapes. In addition, transient response simulations were carried out, and decay rates of the resultant transient response waves were compared to evaluate the energy absorption after the obturator prosthesis had experienced an impact. The results showed that the modal shapes were closely similar, while the amplitudes at the rests and clasps of the hollow type bulb were the smallest. In the transient response simulation, the decay rates of the hollow type were significantly the highest (p < 0.01). In this study, modal analysis demonstrated that the hollow type obturator prosthesis showed the steepest vibration decay slope, indicating that it might be the best among the three types of bulbs for use in clinical treatments Obturator prostheses have been extensively used in the functional rehabilitation of maxillectomy patients.

AB  - Two different spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) were performed on seven young male subjects to evaluate the effects of different color temperatures of light exposure (6700 K, 5000 K, 3000 K) before sleep on cardiac vagal activity. In investigating HRV, we used an ordinary fast Fourier transform (FFT) and coarse graining spectral analysis (CGSA), which selectively extracts random fractal components from a given time series. The results showed that suppressions of HR during sleep after 6700 K light exposure were more inhibited than the other two lighting conditions. Increases in high-frequency (HF) components of HRV during sleep were also inhibited by 6700 K pre-sleep lighting. These results indicate that pre-sleep exposure to light of a higher color temperature may inhibit the enhancement of cardiac vagal activity during sleep. Moreover, significant HF alterations were shown in fractal-free HF (not in ordinary HF) components by CGSA. Because the HF component originates from respiratory sinus arrhythmia with periodical fluctuations, CGSA may be an appropriate approach for HRV evaluation during sleep Two different spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) were performed on seven young male subjects to evaluate the effects of different color temperatures of light exposure (6700 K, 5000 K, 3000 K) before sleep on cardiac vagal activity.

AB  - Parents of autistic children face enormous challenges, but very little attention has been paid to their psychological needs. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has previously been tested with parents as part of a comprehensive package, but not yet alone. The present study used a within-subject, repeated measures design to test the effects of a 2-day ( 14 hour) group ACT workshop on 20 normal parents/guardians of children diagnosed with autism. Parents were assessed three weeks before the workshop, one week before, one week after, and three months after. No significant change occurred while waiting for treatment, but pre to post improvements were found on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Significant pre to follow-up improvements were observed on the BDI-II, BSI, and the General Health Questionnaire- 12. Processes measures of experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion also changed and there was some evidence that these changes mediated outcomes seen.

AB  - Most studies of sustained attention performance obscure the presence and pattern of lapses by reporting measures that are summed across the entire period of an individual's performance, or that are average scores for blocks of trials across many participants. In the present study we attempted to explore fluctuation in the attention of individual participants over the course of a vigilance task and to quantify its periodicity, if any exists. Normal university students listened to letters of the alphabet, arranged randomly and presented at a rate of 2 per second for 20 min. They were instructed to press a hand-held button when they detected a target (two consecutive identical letters). Continuous estimates of performance accuracy (correctly detected targets) at regularly spaced time intervals were created for each participant using a moving time window. The resulting functions were analyzed in order to detect and quantify periodicity using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The most often observed rhythms for those participants with adequate FFT power congregated at 1-2 min, 4-7 min and greater than 10 min. Performance functions from 36 of the 40 subjects displayed at least two of these frequencies.

AB  - HITS (high intensity transient signals) in transcranial Doppler recordings reflect either microemboli, both gaseous and solid, or artefacts. Various frequencies in number of microembolic signals (MES) have been reported in the same clinical condition. A possible explanation for these discrepancies may be different device settings and algorithms for embolus detection. For reproducibility of data, we suggest that studies on MES report the following parameters: (1) Ultrasound device; (2) transducer type; (3) insonated artery; (4) insonation depth; (5) algorithms for signal intensity measurement; (6) scale settings; (7) detection threshold; (8) axial extension of sample volume; (9) fast Fourier transform (FFT) size (number of points used); (10) FFT length (time); (11) FFT overlap; (12) transmitted ultrasound frequency; (13) high pass filter settings; and (14) recording time. No current system of automatic embolus detection has the full sensitivity and specificity required for clinical use. Therefore, each of the signals detected by these devices needs to be checked and verified by an experienced investigator. MES will help to identify the site and activity of the embolizing lesion. Microembolus detection might reduce the observation time and the number of patients needed to perform interventional trials. First, however, MES needs to be validated as a meaningful prognostic parameter. Microemboli originating from prosthetic cardiac valves are mainly gaseous. Therefore, they cannot serve as an indicator of the valves thromboembolic activity or the patient's stroke risk. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported treatment for conduct-disordered young children in which parents learn the skills of child-directed interaction (CDI) in the first phase of treatment and parent-directed interaction (PDI) in the second. This study examined the long-term treatment outcome for 13 families who had participated in a treatment study examining the effects of treatment phase sequence one and two years earlier. Seven families were in the CDI-First treatment group and six families were in the PDI-First group. Immediately after treatment, 11 of the 13 families had achieved clinically significant changes on both observational and parent report measures, and there is no significant difference between treatment groups. Treatment effects were maintained at one-year follow-up for eight of the 13 families, and at two-year follow-up for nine families, with no long- term impact of phase sequence evident at either follow-up assessment. This study represents the first long-term follow-up of families treated with PCIT. Results suggest that this treatment may be successful in achieving long-term gains for most families of conduct-disordered preschoolers and that phase sequence has little impact on treatment outcome.

AB  - The EEG analysis in the time domain provides several advantages compared to the power spectra analysis, based on a FFT. There is the possibility to differentiate frequency, amplitude and other elementary characteristics of the wave form. This technique of EEG analysis is based on the definition of distinct characteristics of the wave form. Problems for calculating the frequency distribution arise--according to Harner, 1977--due to the fact, that the digitalization rate has to be very fast to reach an adequate resolution. On the other hand a high digitalization rate of 5 ms or below produces problems concerning the limited memory capacity of laboratory computers, especially if more than one derivation should be analysed simultaneously, to make further topological analyses possible. Three procedures of EEG analysis to calculate frequency distributions are shown, two of them are based on an interpolation technique to calculate adjusted minima-maxima. The results of these procedures using two different digitalization rates, were compared and discussed to respect similarity of resulting frequency distributions The EEG analysis in the time domain provides several advantages compared to the power spectra analysis, based on a FFT.

AB  - Objectives: Daytime dysfunction and quality of life impairment are important and salient consequences of poor sleep in those with insomnia. Existing measurement approaches to functional impact tend to rely on non-specific generic tools, non-validated scales, or ad hoc single scale items. Here we report the development and validation of the Glasgow Sleep Impact Index (GSII), a novel self-report measure which asks patients to generate, and assess, three domains of impairment unique to their own individual context. These three patient-generated areas of impairment are ranked in order of concern (1-3; i.e. 1 = the most concerning impairment), and then rated on a visual analogue scale with respect to impact in the past two weeks. Patients re-rate these specified areas of impairment, post-intervention, permitting both individual and group-level analyses. Methods: One-hundred and eight patients (71% female; Mean age = 45 yrs) meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for Insomnia Disorder completed the GSII, resulting in the generation of 324 areas (ranks) of sleep-related daytime and quality of life impairment. Fifty-five patients also completed the GSII pre and post-sleep restriction therapy. The following psychometric properties were assessed: content validity of generated domains; relationship between ranks of impairment; and sensitivity to change post-behavioural intervention. Results: Content analysis of generated domains support recent DSM-5 proposals for specification of daytime consequences of insomnia; with the most commonly cited areas reflecting impairments in energy/motivation, work performance, cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, health/well-being, social functioning and relationship/family functioning. Preliminary results with 108 patients indicate the GSII to have excellent face and construct validity. The GSII was found to be sensitive to change, post-behavioural treatment (p < 0.001; Cohen's d >= 0.85 for all three ranks of impairment), and improvements were associated with reductions in insomnia severity in both correlational (range of r = 0.28-0.56) and responder versus non-responder analyses (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The development of the GSII represents a novel attempt to capture and measure sleep-related quality of life impairment in a valid and meaningful way. Further psychometric and clinical evaluation is suggested. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents new projections based on a reappraisal of the current (1971) age distribution and the vital rates. After reviewing previous population projections for India, the demographic implications of 18 combinations of future fertility and mortality are examined. The most likely among these, in the authors' assessment, would yield a population of 922- 970 million in 2001. Using a range of mortality assumptions the authors are able to demonstrate that Indian mortality is still high enough for its future course to have significant impact on population growth. A Postscript presents three extended hypothetical projections based on reaching a net reproduction rate of unity and on simulating the mortality and fertility consequences of major disasters and major social change. All three indicate the high potential for future population growth even in the face of quite radical changes in vital rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The current study examined whether callous-unemotional (CU) traits moderated the effectiveness of Functional Family Therapy for juvenile justice involved adolescents. METHOD Participants were all youths ( n = 134) who had been arrested and participated in an FFT program provided in a community mental health center over a 20-month period (mean age 15.34, 71.6% males, 59% African-American). Parent and self-report ratings of emotional, behavioral, and social functioning, multi-informant ratings of treatment progress, and probation/arrest records were used as outcome indicators. RESULTS CU traits were associated with poorer behavioral, emotional, and social adjustment prior to treatment but they were also associated with greater improvements in adjustment over the course of treatment. CU traits were not associated with significantly lower rates of participation or higher rates of treatment dropout, and the association between CU traits and risk for violent charges decreased after treatment at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. However, CU traits were still correlated with poorer levels of adjustment post-treatment, less perceived change over treatment by youth and their parents, and increased likelihood of violent offending during treatment. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that FFT can lead to improvements in youth with CU traits; however, they enter treatment with a greater number of symptoms and are at higher risk for committing violence during treatment than other youth.

CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that FFT can lead to improvements in youth with CU traits; however, they enter treatment with a greater number of symptoms and are at higher risk for committing violence during treatment than other youth.

AB  - Snoring occurs as a major symptom in patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). The aetiology of snoring remains still unclear despite various attempts to localize snoring. The correlation between different snoring sounds and the severity of SDB has not yet been investigated in a larger population. The aim of this study was to record and analyse snoring sounds and to correlate the obtained data with clinical and polysomnographical parameters. Sixty male patients with suspected SDB and reported snoring underwent a clinical examination and night time polysomnography. The parallel digitally recorded snoring sounds were analysed by fast fourier transformation (FFT). Peak intensity was determined from the power spectrum. The periodicity of snoring was classified into rhythmic and non-rhythmic snoring according to the presence of air flow interruptions due to obstructive apneas. Patients with primary snoring revealed peak intensities between 100 and 300 Hz. Patients with an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) revealed peak intensities above 1,000 Hz. Polysomnographical data (AHI, mean and minimum SpO(2)) as well as body mass index (BMI) correlated with peak intensity of the power spectrum. None of the parameters of the clinical examination correlated with peak intensity. Frequency analysis of snoring sounds provides a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish between different patterns of snoring and respective SDB. The topodiagnosis of snoring is not possible by means of frequency analysis or clinical examination alone. Acoustical analysis of snoring sounds seems a promising additional diagnostic tool to verify different types of SDB in snoring patients Snoring occurs as a major symptom in patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB).

AB  - The number of children and adolescents in the United States requiring care for emotional and behavioral problems is a major public health concern. Increased attention to the limitations of current social service systems to meet the needs of this population led to the development and administration of an innovative outpatient Intensive Home-Based (IHB) treatment program for youth who would typically be placed in hospital or residential care. In this effectiveness study, we examined (1) demographic and clinical characteristics of (N = 48) enrolled youth, (2) determined changes in skills, behaviors, self-esteem, and therapeutic involvement of the clients between intake and a three-month follow-up, (3) examined changes in the skills and behaviors of the parent/caregiver of the child between intake and a three-month follow-up, and (4) calculated the costs of IHB treatment and compared with costs of alternative treatments available in the same community. Results indicated positive outcomes on almost all measures indicated the program's effectiveness, particularly in light of the reduced cost of IHB treatment when compared with hospital or residential care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant. Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug, which is claimed to have superior efficacy and to cause fewer motor adverse effects than typical drugs for people with treatment-resistant illnesses. Clozapine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders, which necessitates mandatory weekly blood monitoring at least during the first months of treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of clozapine compared with typical antipsychotic drugs in people with schizophrenia. SEARCH STRATEGY: For the current update of this review (November 2008) we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: We have included 52 trials (4746 participants) in this review. Forty-four of the included studies are less than 13 weeks in duration, and, overall, trials were at a significant risk of bias. We found no significant difference in the effects of clozapine and typical neuroleptic drugs for broad outcomes such as mortality, ability to work or suitability for discharge at the end of the study. Clinical improvements were seen more frequently in those taking clozapine (n=1119, 14 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.7 to 0.8, NNT 6 CI 5 to 8). Also, participants given clozapine had fewer relapses than those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n=1303, RR 0.62 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 21 CI 15 to 49). BPRS scores showed a greater reduction of symptoms in clozapine-treated participants, (n=1205, 17 RCTs, WMD -3.79 CI -4.9 to -2.7), although the data were heterogeneous ( I2=69%). Short-term data from the SANS negative symptom scores favoured clozapine (n=196, 6 RCTs, WMD -7.21 CI -8.9 to -5.6). We found clozapine to be more acceptable in long-term treatment than conventional antipsychotic drugs (n=982, 6 RCTs, RR 0.60 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 15 CI 12 to 20). Blood problems occurred more frequently in participants receiving clozapine (3.2%) compared with those given typical antipsychotic drugs (0%) (n=1031, 13 RCTs, RR 7.09 CI 2.0 to 25.6). Clozapine participants experienced more drowsiness, hypersalivation or temperature increase, than those given conventional neuroleptics. However, those receiving clozapine experienced fewer motor adverse effects (n=1495, 19 RCTs, RR 0.57 CI 0.5 to 0.7, NNT 5 CI 4 to 6).The clinical effects of clozapine were more pronounced in participants resistant to typical neuroleptics in terms of clinical improvement (n=370, 4 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.6 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 6) and symptom reduction. Thirty-four per cent of treatment-resistant participants had a clinical improvement with clozapine treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine may be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, producing clinically meaningful improvements and postponing relapse, than typical antipsychotic drugs - but data are weak and prone to bias. Participants were more satisfied with clozapine treatment than with typical neuroleptic treatment. The clinical effect of clozapine, however, is, at least in the short-term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The short-term benefits of clozapine have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.The existing trials have largely neglected to assess the views of participants and their families on clozapine. More community-based long-term randomised trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of clozapine on global and social functioning as trials in special groups such as people with learning disabilities. CLOZAPINE VERSUS TYPICAL NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: Schizophrenia is a serious, chronic and relapsing mental illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. Schizophrenia is characterised by 'positive' symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and 'negative' symptoms such as emotional numbness and withdrawal. One quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. Half do have a recurrent illness but with long episodes of considerable recovery from the positive symptoms. The overall cost of the illness to the individual, their carers and the community is considerable.Antipsychotic medications are classified into typical and atypical drugs. First generation or 'typical' antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but negative symptoms are fairly resistant to treatment. In addition, drug treatments are associated with adverse effects which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse.People who do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication are sometimes given the 'atypical' antipsychotic drug clozapine, which has been found to be effective for some people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine is also associated with having fewer movement disorders than chlorpromazine, but may induce life-threatening decreases in white blood cells (agranulocytosis). We reviewed the affects of clozapine in people with schizophrenia compared with typical antipsychotic drugs drugs.This review supports the notion that clozapine is more effective than typical antipsychotic drugs for people with schizophrenia in general, and for those who do not improve on typical antipsychotic drugs in particular. Clozapine is associated with less movement adverse effects than typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause serious blood-related adverse effects. White blood cell count monitoring is mandatory for all people taking clozapine. There is a worry, however, that studies are - at the very least - moderately prone to bias favouring clozapine. Better conduct and reporting of trials could greatly have increased our confidence in the results BACKGROUND: Long-term drug treatment of schizophrenia with typical antipsychotic drugs has limitations: 25 to 33% of sufferers have illnesses that are treatment resistant.

AB  - This review outlines the theory of spectral estimation techniques based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) model and their application to the analysis of human tremor data. Two FFT-based spectral estimation techniques are presented, the Blackman-Tukey and periodogram methods. Factors that influence the quality of spectral estimates are discussed including the choice of windowing function. The theory of parametric modelling is introduced and AR modelling identified as the technique best suited to the analysis of tremor data. The processes of parameter estimation and model order selection are described. The theory of AR spectral estimation is outlined and differences between the AR and FFT-based spectral estimates are summarised. A brief guide to the implementation of FFT-based and AR spectral estimation techniques is given concentrating on data analysis packages that require little or no programming expertise. This review concludes that the AR modelling approach can produce tremor spectra that are superior to those from FFT-based methods for short data sequences. Although the spectral estimates are improved, the benefits of AR modelling for providing information about the physiological mechanisms of tremor generation are not yet clear This review outlines the theory of spectral estimation techniques based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) model and their application to the analysis of human tremor data.

AB  - This review synthesized findings from 17 studies since 1998 regarding evaluation of outpatient treatments for adolescent substance abuse. These studies represented systematic design advances in adolescent clinical trial science. The research examined 46 different intervention conditions with a total sample of 2,307 adolescents. The sample included 7 individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) replications (n = 367), 13 group CBT replications (n = 771), 17 family therapy replications (n = 850) and 9 minimal treatment control conditions (n = 319). The total sample was composed of approximately 75% males, and the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 45% White, 25% Hispanic, 25% African American, and 5% other groups. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate within-group effect sizes as well as differences between active treatment conditions and the minimal treatment control conditions. Methodological rigor of studies was classified using Nathan and Gorman (2002) criteria, and treatments were classified using criteria for well-established and probably efficacious interventions based on Chambless et al. (1996). Three treatment approaches, multidimensional family therapy, functional family therapy, and group CBT emerged as well-established models for substance abuse treatment. However, a number of other models are probably efficacious, and none of the treatment approaches appeared to be clearly superior to any others in terms of treatment effectiveness for adolescent substance abuse.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the extent and the nature of agreement on health-related quality of life (QOL) assessments between terminally ill cancer patients and their primary family caregivers in Japan, using a multidimensional QOL instrument including psychosocial and spiritual domains. Methods: The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being questionnaire was used to assess patients' QOL. Study subjects were inpatients of a palliative care unit (PCU), outpatients who applied for admission to the PCU, and their primary family caregivers. Results: QOL ratings were obtained from 102 of 197 eligible patient-caregiver dyads. A moderate level of patient-family concordance on patients' overall QOL as well as families' underestimation of patients' QOL were observed. Families reported on observable domains of patients' QOL more reliably and assessed subjective aspects, such as psychospiritual concerns less accurately. Families tended to underrate the patients' social aspect of QOL, whereas most patients gave the highest rating on support from their families. The spiritual domain, particularly regarding faith, showed the least agreement. The size of the systematic bias between patient and family assessments on the patients' QOL was moderate (>0.50). Conclusions: Families' limited ability to assess psychosocial and spiritual aspects of patients' QOL may suggest the need for better approaches or measures to assess these aspects of a patient's life. The systematic bias was larger than in earlier studies. Further investigation is needed to identify factors affecting patient-family discord on QOL assessments to guide effective interventions to enhance patient-caregiver agreement.

AB  - A cDNA sequence encoding a soluble form of the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) was produced by RT-PCR amplification. This form of the receptor contains the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, the EGF homology domain, and the serine/threonine-rich domain, but lacks the membrane anchor as well as the cytoplasmic domain. By the same technical approach a cDNA sequence encoding rabbit transferrin was generated. In-frame fusion of the two cDNAs produced a sequence encoding a chimeric protein potentially capable of binding LDL on the N-terminal side and the transferrin receptor on the C-terminal side. It was expected that LDL bound to the chimeric protein could be internalized, targeted to an acidic compartment, and processed through the pathway of the transferrin receptor. Cells transfected with the LDL-R/transferrin cDNA translate, glycosylate, and secrete the corresponding protein in the culture medium. The secreted protein binds LDL in a ligand-blotting experiment. Finally, the chimeric protein mediates the binding and internalization of LDL in mutant cells lacking the LDL receptor. In fact, Watanabe rabbit fibroblasts, incubated with the chimeric protein show a fourfold increase in LDL binding, a fivefold increase in LDL internalization, and a sixfold increase in LDL degradation, with respect to unincubated fibroblasts A cDNA sequence encoding a soluble form of the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) was produced by RT-PCR amplification.

Frequency spectra were generated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and we observed considerable differences between BS spectra of normal subjects and patients. The frequency of peak amplitude and mean frequency of the BS spectra of patients were significantly higher than those of normal subjects. Spectral features were extracted by dividing each spectra into equal frequency bands--each feature being the mean amplitude of each FFT element within a frequency band. We used Principal Component Analysis to compare spectral feature sets and found a clear separation between normal and abnormal tracheal BS for 10, 20, and 40 features/spectra.

AB  - The impact of multiple-family group treatment (MFGT) on outpatient and inpatient mental health service utilization of 97 persons with schizophrenia was investigated. Participants were randomly assigned to standard care ( n=44) or standard care plus MFGT ( n=53). Service use for a year prior to randomization, the 2-year study period, and a 1-year follow-up were examined. Relative to standard care participants, the MFGT group had reduced community hospitalization during year 1 of the intervention and reduced state hospitalization at follow-up. During the intervention period, MFGT participants demonstrated a significant increase in outpatient utilization as a direct consequence of the intervention. However, when service use was summed across 3 years post-randomization, no group differences were observed. Results suggest that implementation of MFGT in a community mental health setting reduces inpatient service at specific time periods, without significantly increasing outpatient service utilization. These findings add to other outcomes from this study that demonstrate decreased psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress.

AB  - Partial and non-adherence to medication is a common problem in schizophrenia, leading to an increased risk of relapse, increased likelihood of hospitalization and poorer long-term outcomes. In contrast, continuous medication in the treatment of schizophrenia is associated with positive outcomes, including improved clinical status, improved quality of life and functioning, and reduced risk of relapse and rehospitalization. Strategies aimed at improving medication adherence are therefore key for patients to achieve their treatment goals. In an attempt to address the issues of partial/non-adherence to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia, a group of psychiatrists convened to discuss and develop a set of principles aimed at helping patients adhere to their medication. These principles were then refined and developed into the STAY (the Six principles to improve Treatment Adherence in Your patients) initiative following presentation to a wider group of psychiatrists from across Europe. This manuscript summarizes these principles and explains the rationale for their selection. These principles are: (1) recognizing that most patients with schizophrenia are at risk of partial/non-adherence at some time during the course of their illness; (2) the benefits of a good therapeutic alliance for identifying potential adherence issues; (3) tailored treatment plans to meet an individual's needs, including the most suitable route of delivery of antipsychotic medication; (4) involving family/key persons in care and psychoeducation of the patient, assuming the patient agrees to this; (5) ensuring optimal effectiveness of care; and (6) ensuring continuity in the care of patients with schizophrenia. The application of these six principles should help to raise awareness of and address poor patient adherence, as well as generally improving care of patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - An algorithm based only on the impedance cardiogram (ICG) recorded through two defibrillation pads, using the strongest frequency component and amplitude, incorporated into a defibrillator could determine circulatory arrest and reduce delays in starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Frequency analysis of the ICG signal is carried out by integer filters on a sample by sample basis. They are simpler, lighter and more versatile when compared to the FFT. This alternative approach, although less accurate, is preferred due to the limited processing capacity of devices that could compromise real time usability of the FFT. These two techniques were compared across a data set comprising 13 cases of cardiac arrest and 6 normal controls. The best filters were refined on this training set and an algorithm for the detection of cardiac arrest was trained on a wider data set. The algorithm was finally tested on a validation set. The ICG was recorded in 132 cardiac arrest patients (53 training, 79 validation) and 97 controls (47 training, 50 validation): the diagnostic algorithm indicated cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 81.1% (77.6-84.3) and specificity of 97.1% (96.7-97.4) for the validation set (95% confidence intervals).

AB  - Inter-patient comparisons of cardiovascular metrics indicative of patient health have been shown to be successful in differentiating patients on a group rather than an individual level. This is in part due to the range of mental (as well as physical) activity-based variations for each patient and the difficulty assessing physical and mental activity during conscious states. In order to provide an objective scale for measuring central nervous system activity during sleep, the heart rate (RR) interval time series is divided into coarse sleep stage segments in which the LF/HF-ratio (the relative balance between low and high frequency power) is estimated for age and sex-matched populations of apnoeic and healthy subjects. Activity-based noise is therefore reduced and a more useful comparison of heart rate variability can be made. Additionally, the spectral estimation performances of the FFT and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), a Fourier-based technique for unevenly sampled time series are compared. Separation of patients according to condition is shown to be more pronounced when using the LSP than the FFT.

Separation of patients according to condition is shown to be more pronounced when using the LSP than the FFT. Furthermore, separation is found to be most marked in slow wave sleep

AB  - This ex post facto survey examined 75 client family members' perceptions of live observation/supervision of family therapy at a university clinic. The results seem to reflect the subjects' general satisfaction with the process, although this general satisfaction did not significantly predict outcome on either family or therapist goal attainment scores. Family members whose therapists were female reported greater satisfaction with the process than those with male therapists, although no differences by therapist gender were found on either therapist or family goal attainment scale scores. Open-ended responses suggested that some family members were aware of the purposes of certain strategic team interventions. Implications of findings for the practice and research of live supervision and/or observation are discussed.

AB  - The sensitivity of Doppler spectral indices (mean frequency, maximum frequency, spectral broadening index and turbulence intensity) to the conditions of spectral analysis (estimation method, data window, smoothing window or model order) increases with decreasing signal bandwidth and growing index complexity. The bias of spectral estimate has a more important effect on these indices than its variance. A too low order, in the case of autoregressive modeling and minimum variance methods, and excessive smoothing, in the case of the FFT method, result in increased errors of Doppler spectral indices. There is a trade-off between the errors resulting from a short data window and those due to insufficient temporal resolution The sensitivity of Doppler spectral indices (mean frequency, maximum frequency, spectral broadening index and turbulence intensity) to the conditions of spectral analysis (estimation method, data window, smoothing window or model order) increases with decreasing signal bandwidth and growing index complexity.

AB  - This pilot study compared the efficacy of two models of family therapy plus medication in the treatment of ten schizophrenic patients previously considered poor responders to neuroleptics alone. Focal Family Therapy (FFT), a limited psychodynamic model, was compared with Supportive Management Counselling (SMC), an educative, problem-solving approach. Family treatment was begun during admission to hospital and continued for up to six months post-discharge. Patient and family measures were administered on assessment, termination, and at three, six and 12 month follow-up interviews. Our data suggest that patients in both groups improved significantly following treatment on measures of social functioning and community tenure. The average increase in amount of time out of hospital was a full year, compared to previous rates. Patients receiving FFT demonstrated significantly greater improvement in symptoms, compared to patients in the SMC group.

AB  - Objective evidence which supports an association between the forward flexion test (FFT) and sacroiliac joint dysfunction is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of a positive FFT in a sample of young adults (N = 128), and to examine the association of factors such as low back pain, pelvic skeletal asymmetry, age, height, weight, and stance asymmetry. The history of back pain and the results of the FFT were recorded and measurements of height, weight, preferred stance angle and asymmetry ratio were taken. Descriptive statistics were used to present the anthropometric and FFT data, and t-tests were used to examine differences between females and males, and subjects with and without a positive FFT. The 0.05 level of significance was selected. Of the subjects tested 24% (n = 31 ) had a positive FFT and the highest occurrence of a positive FFT was in male subjects (n = 19). Nine asymptomatic subjects had a positive FFT. Statistically significant differences were observed between the positive and negative FFT groups for height, weight and asymmetry ratio (p > 0.05). It is concluded that factors other than sacroiliac joint dysfunction are likely to be the cause of a positive FFT Objective evidence which supports an association between the forward flexion test (FFT) and sacroiliac joint dysfunction is lacking.

AB  - Brain's alpha activity and alpha responses belong to major electrical signals that are related to sensory/ cognitive signal processing. The present study aims to analyze the spontaneous alpha activity and visual evoked alpha response in drug free euthymic bipolar patients. Eighteen DSM-IV euthymic bipolar patients (bipolar I n = 15, bipolar II n = 3) and 18 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Patients needed to be euthymic at least for 4 weeks and psychotrop free for at least 2 weeks. Spontaneous EEG (4 min eyes closed, 4 min eyes open) and evoked alpharesponse upon application of simple visual stimuli were analyzed. EEG was recorded at 30 positions. The digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis was performed forspontaneous eyes closed and eyes open conditions and the response power spectrumwas also analyzed for simple visual stimuli. In the analysis of spontaneous EEG, the ANOVAon alpha responses revealed significant results for groups (F (1,34) = 8.703; P<0.007). Post-hoc comparisons showed that spontaneous EEG alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than the spontaneous EEG alpha power of euthymic patients. Furthermore, visual evoked alpha power of healthy subjects was significantly higher than visual evoked alpha power of euthymic patients (F (1,34) = 4.981; P<0.04). Decreased alpha activity in spontaneous EEG is an important pathological EEG finding in euthymic bipolar patients. Together with an evident decrease in evoked alpha responses, the findings may lead to a new pathway in search of biological correlates of cognitiveimpairment in bipolar disorder. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V Brain's alpha activity and alpha responses belong to major electrical signals that are related to sensory/ cognitive signal processing.

AB  - To describe the eligibility criteria (i.e. study participant inclusion and exclusion rules) employed in alcohol treatment outcome research and to identify predictors of their use. The eligibility criteria of 683 alcohol treatment outcome studies conducted between 1970 and 1998 were coded reliably into 14 general categories. Predictors of the use of eligibility criteria were then examined. Patients were most often ruled ineligible for research studies because of their level of alcohol problems (39.1% of studies), comorbid psychiatric problems (37.8%), past or concurrent utilization of alcohol treatment (31.8%), co-occurring medical conditions (31.6%), and because they were deemed non-compliant and unmotivated (31.5%). The number of eligibility criteria employed in studies increased from the 1970s through the 1990s, and was positively associated with funding from the US National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and from the private sector, lack of an inpatient/residential treatment condition, presence of a pharmacotherapy, and use of a randomized, multiple-condition design. Principal investigators with doctoral degrees used more eligibility criteria than those with lower degrees. Participant eligibility criteria are extensively employed in alcohol treatment outcome research, and vary significantly across historical periods, funders and research designs. Researchers should report the details of subject eligibility criteria and excluded patients more fully, and, evaluate how eligibility criteria affect the cost, feasibility, and generalizability of treatment outcome research.

AB  - The main aims of this study were 1) a fine spatial analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations after galvanic painful stimulation (nonpainful stimulation as a reference) and 2) a comparative evaluation of phase- and nonphase-locked component of these EEG oscillations. Preliminary surface Laplacian transformation of EEG data (31 channels) reduced head volume conductor effects. EEG phase values were computed by FFT analysis and the statistical evaluation of these values was performed by Rayleigh test (P < 0.05). About 50% of the EEG single trials presented statistically the same FFT phase value of the evoked EEG oscillations (phase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant phase-locked compared to nonphase-locked component. The remaining single trials showed random FFT phase values (nonphase-locked single trials), indicating a preponderant nonphase-locked compared to phase-locked component. Compared to nonpainful stimulation, painful stimulation increased phase-locked theta to gamma band responses in the contralateral hemisphere and decreased the phase-locked beta band response in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, nonphase-locked alpha band response decreased in the ipsilateral fronto-central area. In conclusion, both decreased and increased EEG oscillatory responses to galvanic painful stimulation would occur in parallel in different cortical regions and in the phase- and nonphase-locked EEG data sets. This enriches the actual debate on the mapping of event-related oscillatory activity of human brain.

The predictions of the Fermi-Eyges theory and of the second-order theory are compared with modified Monte Carlo calculations, demonstrating the increased accuracy of the latter multiple-scattering theory. We derive and compare broad-beam angular distributions for the two theories, and note the effect of large-angle scattering upon dose profiles.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study describes a non-invasive method for the in vivo assessment of precorneal tear film stability. METHODS: A lateral shearing interferometer (LSI) is used for the measurement. The interference fringes obtained from the tear film layer are analysed using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique. The method is based on evaluating the degree of fringe disturbance by calculation of the second momentum of Fourier spectra on the interferogram pattern. RESULTS: This method points to the occurrence of dynamic changes in the tear film surface over time. We propose four different parameters. One of them is presented here. The less smooth the tear film, the more disturbed the interference fringes and the higher the value of the calculation parameters. Clear differences were discerned between tear film quality in healthy eyes, dry eyes and eyes with various contact lenses. The benefits of artificial tears used by patients with dry eye or contact lenses were also noted. Examination of dry eyes before and after applying fluorescein revealed significant differences in tear film stability. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral shearing interferometry is a suitable method for assessing the stability of the tear film on the cornea and on contact lenses. Evident differences can be demonstrated in tear film quality between normal eyes and dry eyes or eyes with soft contact lenses PURPOSE: This study describes a non-invasive method for the in vivo assessment of precorneal tear film stability.

AB  - We quantitatively examined the difference in perceived size between upright and inverted faces using the method of constant stimuli. The stimuli included eight face images modified from two cartoon faces produced by Kitaoka (2007, http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/-akitaoka/kao-e.html and 2008, Cognitive Psychology 5 177-185) and six photographic faces, including a photographic face used by Thompson (2010, http://illusionncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2010/the-fat-face-thin-fft-ilusion/). Experiment 1 showed that an upright face and outline were perceived to be significantly smaller than an inverted face and outline, respectively. Moreover, the amount of the size underestimation in the face stimulus condition was significantly larger than that in the outline stimulus condition. Experiment 2 showed that an upright face was perceived to be significantly smaller than 90 degrees and 270 degrees rotated faces, whereas an inverted face was not perceived to be significantly larger than a 90 degrees or 270 degrees rotated face. Experiment 3 showed that upright faces were perceived to be significantly smaller than upright and inverted outlines, whereas inverted faces were not perceived to be significantly larger than upright or inverted outlines. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that upright photographic faces were also perceived to be significantly smaller than inverted photographic faces.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore intimate friendship between women and to examine how it is marginalized within the context of systemic therapy. I argue that the field of marriage and family therapy is a microcosm of societal norms, as patriarchal and heterosexist notions continue to inform clinical perceptions of intimacy. The narrowly defined relational categories of marriage and family therapy will be considered and critiqued. To understand the dynamics that perpetuate this oppression of women, a historical perspective will be employed to provide a context for current friendship patterns.

AB  - We have previously shown that bereavement life review therapy improves the spiritual well-being of a bereaved family, but the factors that influence the efficacy of this therapy have not been determined. Therefore, this study was performed to identify factors associated with improvement of spiritual well-being of bereaved families. The participants were 21 bereaved family members who lost a relative who had been treated in a palliative care unit in Japan. The family members received the Bereavement Life Review over two sessions of about 60 min each. In the first session, the bereaved family member reviewed their memories of the deceased relative with a clinical psychologist and answered several questions. After the first session, the psychologist made an album. In the second session, the family member and the psychologist confirmed the accuracy of the contents of the album. Assessment was performed using the Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual score, based on which the participants were separated into effective and non-effective groups. Factors were extracted from the narrative of the therapy using a text-mining software. Factors such as "good memories of family," "loss and reconstruction," and "pleasant memories of last days" were commonly found in the effective group, whereas factors such as "suffering with memories," "regret and sense of guilt," and "disagreement on funeral arrangements" were more common in the non-effective group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is a popular method of spectral analysis of atrial fibrillation cycle lengths (AFCL). Autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis is also available, so the aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between FFT and ACF analyses in the spectral analysis of AFCLs. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 75 atrial fibrillation (AF) data from 39 patients were subjected to analysis. The dominant frequencies (DFs) from 4 different spectral resolutions of the FFT and peak AFCL from the ACF analysis were compared. In the FFT analysis using rectified signals, the DF was influenced by spectral resolution, no matter how the signals were tapered by the Hanning or Hamming window or filtered with the low-pass filter. There was a significant relationship between the DF from each spectral resolution and the peak AFCL. The DF from the 4,096-point FFT analysis had the strongest relationship to the peak AFCL with the smallest difference, when using 30-s AF data. In a study of the different lengths of the atrial fibrillation data, the DF also had a strong correlation to the peak AFCL with a small difference. CONCLUSIONS: The peak AFCL obtained from ACF analysis was not of the same quality as that from FFT analysis, but had the same value as the DF from FFT analysis BACKGROUND: Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is a popular method of spectral analysis of atrial fibrillation cycle lengths (AFCL).

AB  - We conducted color Doppler ultrasonographic examination (CDU) of 123 patients with pancreatic tumors to determine if CDU can be used in the differential diagnosis of these lesions. Results of pathologic diagnosis showed 92 of these tumors to be ductal carcinomas; 9, intraductal papillary adenomas or adenocarcinomas; 5, neuroendocrine tumors; 3, mucinous cystadenomas or cystadenocarcinomas; 3, serous cystadenomas; 3, solid cystic tumors; 2, adenosquamous carcinomas; 2, leiomyosarcomas; and 4, tumors forming chronic pancreatitis. Color images were detected in 5 (5%) of the 92 ductal carcinomas, 4 (80%) of the 5 neuroendocrine tumors, and all of the 2 adenosquamous carcinomas and 2 leiomyosarcomas. Wave forms by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm mode were pulsatile in 2 (40%) of the 5 ducted carcinomas with color images and pulsatile in 7 (78%) of the 9 non- ducted tumors with color images.

AB  - In this study, topographic brain mapping and wavelet transform-neural network method are used for the classification of grand mal (clonic stage) and petit mal (absence) epilepsies into healthy, ictal and interictal (EEGs). Preprocessing is included to remove artifacts occurred by blinking, wandering baseline (electrodes movement) and eyeball movement using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). De-noising EEG signals from the AC power supply frequency with a suitable notch filter is another job of preprocessing. In experimental data, the preprocessing enhanced speed and accuracy of the processing stage (wavelet transform and neural network). The EEGs signals are categorized to normal and petit mal and clonic epilepsy by an expert neurologist. The categorization is confirmed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis and brain mapping. The dataset includes waves such as sharp, spike and spike-slow wave. Through the Counties Wavelet Transform (CWT) of EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and separated and used as classifier input. We introduce a two-stage classifier based on the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network location in both time and frequency contexts. The brain mapping used for finding the epilepsy locates in the brain. The simulation results are very promising and the accuracy of the proposed classifier in experimental clinical data is ~80%.

The unquestioned reinforcement of stereotyped sex roles takes place in much of family therapy. A feminist therapy orientation that considers the consequences of stereotyped sex roles and the statuses prescribed by society for females and males should be part of family therapy practice.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to make clear the relaxative effects of supine floating (SF) on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac autonomic nervous activity in males. Ten males served as subjects (n=10, mean age: 22.4 yrs). All subjects gave informed consent before participating. Water and room temperature were 30 degrees C. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured during SF or control (C) conditions. Cardiac autonomic nerve activity was estimated with the power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). High frequency (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz) and the ratio of low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) to HF (LF/HF) were used as an indicator of cardiac vagal activity and sympatho-vagal balance, respectively. Those values were showed logarithmically (LogHF and LogLF/LogHF). LogHF during SF condition was significantly increased, LogLF/LogHF, heart rate and blood pressure were significantly decreased. These data indicate that cardiac vagal activity is enhanced and sympathetic nervous activity is suppressed by reciprocal response The purpose of this study was to make clear the relaxative effects of supine floating (SF) on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac autonomic nervous activity in males.

AB  - In the last 10 years, several reviews of research on violence among girls have been conducted. This research helps to determine the extent of girls' use of violence however, it has not been translated into effective prevention programs for girls. This article reviews the research on risk and protective factors associated with violence, with particular attention on factors unique to girls or shared between boys and girls. Individual risk factors for youth violence include hyperactivity/inattention/impulsivity, risk taking/sensation seeking, low academic achievement, exposure to stress and victimization, and early puberty. Parent-child relationships/parental monitoring and supervision, parent criminal and antisocial behavior, and family conflicts and instability have been found to be relationship-level risk factors. Peer risk factors include deviant peer affiliation and gang membership. Risk factors at the community level include economic deprivation; community disorganization; the availability of drugs, alcohol, and firearms; and neighborhood crime. This review also includes a description of program effects for girls within the Model and Promising Blueprints for Violence Prevention Initiative programs. Very few evaluations have examined program effectiveness in preventing violence among girls. More evaluation research is needed to determine if evidence-based programs have positive impact on reducing violence and related risk factors among girls.

In the last 10 years, several reviews of research on violence among girls have been conducted. This research helps to determine the extent of girls' use of violence however, it has not been translated into effective prevention programs for girls. This article reviews the research on risk and protective factors associated with violence, with particular attention on factors unique to girls or shared between boys and girls. Individual risk factors for youth violence include hyperactivity/inattention/impulsivity, risk taking/sensation seeking, low academic achievement, exposure to stress and victimization, and early puberty. Parent-child relationships/parental monitoring and supervision, parent criminal and antisocial behavior, and family conflicts and instability have been found to be relationship-level risk factors. Peer risk factors include deviant peer affiliation and gang membership. Risk factors at the community level include economic deprivation; community disorganization; the availability of drugs, alcohol, and firearms; and neighborhood crime. This review also includes a description of program effects for girls within the Model and Promising Blueprints for Violence Prevention Initiative programs. Very few evaluations have examined program effectiveness in preventing violence among girls. More evaluation research is needed to determine if evidence-based programs have positive impact on reducing violence and related risk factors among girls.

AB  - Autonomic control of hemodynamics is crucial to maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis after orthostasis. Our goal was to assess the effect of passive orthostatic stress on cardiovascular hemodynamics regulation by analysis of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and gender influence on the variables. We used a passive 70 degrees tilt test as an orthostatic maneuver. For SNA measurements we used FFT for HRV and SBPV, temporal sequences and alpha index to calculate baroreceptor gain. Hemodynamic data was calculated non-invasively by modelflow. Orthostatic stress induces a rise in heart rate (+15%), total peripheral resistance (+28%), sympathetic tonus (LF_nu: +32%; LF_pas: +64%) and a reduction in cardiac output (-28%), systolic volume (-43%), and vagal activity both tonic (HF_nu:-115%) and reflex (BRG:-103%). Females had higher vagal activity regardless of position.

AB  - Objectives: Stroke survivors experience the loss of muscle mass and muscle atrophy changes on the paretic lower limbs as well as the non-paretic side. Traditional stroke rehabilitation intervention concerned whether the resistive exercise was available and safe for the patient with stroke. This study is aim to investigate the influence of postures and low intensity strengthening resistive exercises for heart rate variability (HRV) and subjective responses in the patients with stroke. Methods: Thirteen participants (eight men, five women; aged 50-70 years) were recruited. Registry eligibility criteria included: (1) clinical stroke diagnosis consistent with the WHO definition, confirmed by clinical assessment or imaging. (2) 3-6 months after onset of first stroke. (3) Mini-Mental Status Exam score large than 16. The experimental protocol was to carry out a different posture and two intermittent elastic resistive exercise training. Postures and band grades (Yellow and Blue Thera-Band bands) were randomised in each participant. Participants were required to perform the knee extension with 100% elongation band exercises at supine or sitting posture. There were 5 min resting periods after four resistive exercising training tasks. HRV signal was collected utilising the Polar heart rate monitor (Polar Electro, Finland). The signal processing of HRV were performed in fast Fourier transforms (FFT) using a HRV analysis software (Kubios HRV, 2.0, University of Eastern Finland, 2008). Heart rate, blood pressure, rating perceived exertion (RPE) and anxiety score (1-4) were recorded post each task and resting period. Results: We performed the repeated measure ANOVA to examine the variables among four condition tasks included two postures and two grade resistive exercises. The results indicated that there were significant interactions for LF/HF ratio of HRV (F (1, 12)=9.536, p=0.013), RPE (F (1, 12)=13.656, p=0.002), and anxiety level (F (1, 12)=10.343, p=0.004) during four task conditions. There were no significant responses for LF/HF ratio, RPE, and anxiety level during all resting periods. Paired t-test was also computed to compare the differences among four task conditions. The results were shown that there was significant higher response for RPE (p=0.043) and anxiety level (p=0.026) than other task conditions during higher workload (Blue band) at sitting posture. To compare the responses during resting periods, there were no significant differences for all variables. Conclusions: This study results suggested that intermittent elastic resistive exercise can induce different HRV responses at LF/HR ratio and subjective responses but no significant cumulative effects after the following rests. Short-term low intensity strengthening exercises in sitting or supine postures is the feasible programme can be conducted for the patients with stroke under supervision Objectives: Stroke survivors experience the loss of muscle mass and muscle atrophy changes on the paretic lower limbs as well as the non-paretic side.

Thirty-two families were randomly assigned to PCIT ( n=20) or a 3.5-month waiting-list condition (WL; n=12). Participants from both groups completed pretreatment and posttreatment assessments. Outcome measures included child's ADHD symptoms and behavior problems, parent or family functioning, and parents' satisfaction with treatment. ANCOVAs with pretreatment measures entered as covariates were significant for all posttreatment outcomes, except mother's depression, and in the expected direction ( p<.01). Mothers reported a highly significant reduction in pretreatment hyperactivity and inattention and less aggressive and oppositional-defiant behaviors, conduct problems assessed as problematic, parenting stress associated with their child's behavior, and an increase in the use of adequate parenting practices. For the WL group, there were no clinically significant changes in any measure. Treatment gains obtained after treatment were maintained at a 3.5-month follow-up assessment. PCIT seems to be an efficacious intervention for Puerto Rican families who have young children with significant behavior problems.

AB  - To investigate the sleep spindle activity of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC), we simultaneously recorded whole nights of polysomnographic and electrocorticographic (ECoG) activities during the natural sleep of epileptic patients. Subjects were nine patients with intractable epilepsy who had subdural electrodes surgically attached to the orbital (seven cases), medial (three cases), or dorsolateral (two cases) PFC, and in one case to the frontal pole. To examine spindle frequencies, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and auto-correlation analyses were performed on the PFC ECoG and Cz EEG data, primarily on epochs of stage 2 sleep. Lower sigma band ECoG oscillations of about 12 Hz were widely distributed across all prefrontal cortical areas including the frontal limbic regions, but none of the PFC sigma frequency peaks coincided with the faster (about 14 Hz) Cz EEG sleep spindles. Combining our results with anatomical and electrophysiological facts, it is suggested that the thalamofrontal circuit involving the rostral reticular and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is responsible for the generation of 12 Hz frontal spindles in humans.

AB  - The current clinical standard for the analysis of intracoronary Doppler signals is the application of a zero-crossing (ZC) detector. However, the accuracy of the method is questionable, especially in areas of disturbed flow, as confirmed by in vitro studies, animal experiments, and intraoperative observations. The aim of this study is the comparison of a conventional ZC detector and a custom-designed spectral analyzer (fast Fourier transform, FFT) in the analysis of intracoronary Doppler signals obtained in 19 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. A 3F catheter with an end-mounted Doppler ceramic crystal was placed over an 0.014" guidewire in a normal or near-normal segment proximal to the lesion to be dilated. The Doppler signal was recorded before and after intracoronary infusion of 12.5 mg of papaverine. In 9 patients high flow velocities could be recorded when the catheter was advanced across the stenosis. The blood flow velocity measurements obtained with ZC were significantly lower than the maximal FFT flow velocity measurements (16 +/- 12 cm/s vs. 29 +/- 18 cm/s, p < .001). In all the conditions of Doppler signal acquisition (baseline, hyperemia, stenosis) a large scattering of the signed differences between corresponding measurements was observed. The standard deviation of the difference ZC-FFT was +/- 11 cm/s and +/- 5 cm/s for the maximal and mean FFT flow velocity, corresponding in both cases to +/- 37% of the mean of the ZC and FFT measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The current clinical standard for the analysis of intracoronary Doppler signals is the application of a zero-crossing (ZC) detector.

AB  - Fourier analysis is used to study resolution of images processed by the matrix of simulated red-center (BCR) and green-center (BCG) bipolar cells (BC) of the human central fovea. Simulated achromatic and chromatic sine and square waves, and a two-bar stimulus are used to activate the BCs. Due to the "honeycomb" packing of the cones and BC matrices Fourier transforms are computed row by row using a one-dimensional FFT. Resolution computed by the Fourier transform is compared with the resolution index (RI), which is a method for determining resolution based on two-point discrimination in the space domain. In general the harmonic with the maximum amplitude gives the best correlation with RI for the three stimuli. Amplitudes at all spatial frequencies are enhanced by increasing the number of cycles in the sine and square wave gratings. Results with simulated BCs compare favorably with human and macaque psychophysics measuring contrast sensitivity.

AB  - (from the introduction) Adolescents with behavior problems go by various labels, such as difficult-to-treat adolescents, juvenile delinquents, at-risk youth, violent youth, and youthful offenders. They may have disruptive behavior disorder or substance abuse disorder, and they may be involved with the criminal justice system. These youth have problematic behaviors, emotions, and ways of thinking that often affect not only their families, but also their community. These youth, their families, and their successful treatment represent the focus of this book. Although family members are often dissatisfied with the youth<ef><bf><bd>_Ts behavior and intensely focused on the need for him or her to change, the youth rarely self-refers and often seems undisturbed by his or her own behaviors and is typically unmotivated for treatment. At the same time, parents and other family members seem heavily invested in viewing problems in the family as resulting from the adolescent<ef><bf><bd>_Ts bad behavior. Therefore, some family members also are unmotivated or unwilling to be involved in the youth<ef><bf><bd>_Ts treatment. Given the multifaceted barriers to adaptive change, treatment is needed that addresses the entire family system in a holistic way. Over the past 40 years, numerous researchers and clinicians have developed, tested, and refined Functional Family Therapy (FFT)<ef><bf><bd>_"a short-term, structured, intensive family intervention model for delinquent and substance-using adolescents. FFT is a strength-based model with a focus on those risk and protective factors that impact the adolescent and his or her environment. On average, 12 sessions are conducted over a 3- to 4-month period. These sessions typically occur in clinics and home settings but can also be conducted in schools, mental health agencies, child welfare agencies, probation and parole offices, and aftercare systems. We have written this book with the clinician in mind. We often maintain a quite personal tone because we want to share and talk with you rather than taking a more traditional academic tone by talking to you. Often we use examples of specific youth and families (with disguised identities, of course) so clinicians can experience the clinical reality of these youth and families. We describe not only the goals of each intervention strategy and technique but also the specific steps and variations that are involved and necessary for success. At the same time, because FFT also derives strength from our history of widespread dissemination and training, we also share information relevant to decision makers, program administrators, clinical supervisors, clinical researchers, and even legislatures who have the responsibility of how best to allocate funds to provide the most effective services. In the remainder of this Introduction, we discuss FFT<ef><bf><bd>_Ts conceptualization of change as a developmental process and outline the five major treatment phases of FFT. Then we explain the organization of this book. As we describe the FFT phases and the techniques and therapist qualities involved in each, our strategy in this book is to move from a broad focus to a narrow focus, then back again to a broad focus.

These youth have problematic behaviors, emotions, and ways of thinking that often affect not only their families, but also their community. These youth, their families, and their successful treatment represent the focus of this book. Although family members are often dissatisfied with the youth<ef><bf><bd>_Ts behavior and intensely focused on the need for him or her to change, the youth rarely self-refers and often seems undisturbed by his or her own behaviors and is typically unmotivated for treatment. At the same time, parents and other family members seem heavily invested in viewing problems in the family as resulting from the adolescent<ef><bf><bd>_Ts bad behavior. Therefore, some family members also are unmotivated or unwilling to be involved in the youth<ef><bf><bd>_Ts treatment. Given the multifaceted barriers to adaptive change, treatment is needed that addresses the entire family system in a holistic way. Over the past 40 years, numerous researchers and clinicians have developed, tested, and refined Functional Family Therapy (FFT)<ef><bf><bd>_"a short-term, structured, intensive family intervention model for delinquent and substance-using adolescents. FFT is a strength-based model with a focus on those risk and protective factors that impact the adolescent and his or her environment. On average, 12 sessions are conducted over a 3- to 4-month period. These sessions typically occur in clinics and home settings but can also be conducted in schools, mental health agencies, child welfare agencies, probation and parole offices, and aftercare systems. We have written this book with the clinician in mind. We often maintain a quite personal tone because we want to share and talk with you rather than taking a more traditional academic tone by talking to you. Often we use examples of specific youth and families (with disguised identities, of course) so clinicians can experience the clinical reality of these youth and families. We describe not only the goals of each intervention strategy and technique but also the specific steps and variations that are involved and necessary for success. At the same time, because FFT also derives strength from our history of widespread dissemination and training, we also share information relevant to decision makers, program administrators, clinical supervisors, clinical researchers, and even legislatures who have the responsibility of how best to allocate funds to provide the most effective services. In the remainder of this Introduction, we discuss FFT<ef><bf><bd>_Ts conceptualization of change as a developmental process and outline the five major treatment phases of FFT. Then we explain the organization of this book. As we describe the FFT phases and the techniques and therapist qualities involved in each, our strategy in this book is to move from a broad focus to a narrow focus, then back again to a broad focus.

AB  - A number of brain regions are associated with the subjective experience of pain. This study adds to our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in pain by considering the relation between cortical oscillations in response to pain, with and without hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia, and the subjective experience of pain. Thirty-three subjects' neural responses (EEG) were measured during the 40-540 ms period following phasic electrical stimulations to the right hand, under control and hypnosis conditions. Resultant FFT amplitudes for frequencies ranging from 8 to 100 Hz were computed. These were grouped into 7 scalp topographies, and for each frequency, relations between these topographies and pain ratings, performance and stimulus intensity measures were assessed. Gamma activity (32-100 Hz) over prefrontal scalp sites predicted subject pain ratings in the control condition (r=0.50, P=0.004), and no other frequency/topography combination did. This relation was present in both high and low hypnotisable subjects and was independent of performance and stimulus intensity measures. This relation was unchanged by hypnosis in the low hypnotisable subjects but was not present in the highs during hypnosis, suggesting that hypnosis interferes with this pain/gamma relation. This study provides evidence for the role of gamma oscillations in the subjective experience of pain. Further, it is in keeping with the view that hypnosis involves the dissociation of prefrontal cortex from other neural functions A number of brain regions are associated with the subjective experience of pain.

AB  - Attempts to elucidate the complex pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) must consider subjective and objective sleep. Several reports of CFS showed the high rate of sleep disturbance such as insomnia, hypersomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome and so on. To analyze pulse wave continuously in sleep of CFS patients by laser blood flowmeter, we set base line component (0.01-0.08 Hz) and pulse wave component(0.70-1.50 Hz). Results of FFT analysis indicate that the CFS can have at least three subtypes of pulse dynamics in sleep. There probably are different types of illnesses now contained within the CFS construct, in which identifying subtypes of sleep disturbance can be one important key.

AB  - Introduction: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is one of methods which have been used to investigate mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue [1]. The muscle fatigue is specific to contraction type, intensity and duration of activity therefore relationships seen e.g. in the isometric muscle contraction are not the same in the dynamic exercise. Therefore, based on previous experience in that evaluation the effectiveness of the estimation of fatigue for individual lower extremities muscles during the run at various intensity was the aim. Patients/materials and methods: Four athletes took part in this research. EMG measurements were recorded during the run on tartan athletic track. The athlete had to run 400m distance with a different intensity. The first distance of 400m took 90 s, the second one 70 s, the third one 60 s and the last one was performed with maximal intensity. Bipolar surface EMG recordings were obtained from the rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris - long head (BF) of right and left thigh were obtained. The raw SEMG signal was recorded at the sampling rate of 1000 Hz using a device ME3000P4. Power spectral analysis were performed to calculate MPF on 1024-point (Hamming window processing) by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) technique. All participants signed written consent form and proper consent was obtained from Warsaw UPE Ethical Committee. Results: Fatigue comparison for individual muscles depending on the intensity of run was described by slopes of regression lines estimated by method of least squares. The values of slope coefficients are presented in Table 1. Significant differences between the slopes for muscles of left and right limbs were noticed. For both muscles slopes increased with increasing intensity of the race. That increase was, however, stronger for the left limb. It is worth noting that the differences between left and right limbs are more strongly marked for the RF muscle. Table 1 - average values and standard deviation (SD) of the regression line slopes computed on the value of MPF for the run at different intensities: 1 - the 90s run, 2 - 70s, 3 - 60s, 4 - run with maximal intensity. Discussion and conclusion: The biggest changes in MPF were observed for BF (23.6%) and RF (19.5%) muscles of the left leg and then for BF (17.5%) and RF (12.5%) of the right leg. Further research requires the phenomenon of the MPF local minimum observed between 18 and 22 s. This phenomenon is probably related to the collapse of energy associated with the ATP-PC resynthesis. Because sEMG allows to investigate activation of a single muscle separately during performance, we know that the changes are different in BF and RF of right and left limb. We suppose that those differences (between right and left leg) were mainly due to the curve of the track where those muscles were differently loaded Introduction: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is one of methods which have been used to investigate mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue [1].

AB  - Current signal processing technology has driven many advances in almost every aspect of life, including medical applications. It follows that applying signal processing techniques to pulse oximetry could also provide major improvements. This research was designed to identify and implement one or more techniques that could improve pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements. The hypothesis was that frequency domain analysis could more easily extract the cardiac rate and amplitude of interest from the time domain signal. The focus was on the digital signal processing algorithms that had potential to improve pulse oximetry readings, and then test those algorithms. This was accomplished using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The results indicate that the FFT and DCT computation of oxygen saturation were as accurate without averaging, as weighted moving average (WMA) algorithms currently being used, and directly indicate when erroneous calculations occur Current signal processing technology has driven many advances in almost every aspect of life, including medical applications.

AB  - Conservative Protestant child discipline has recently become the subject of considerable social research and public controversy. However, no systematic empirical evidence has been brought to bear on conservative Protestant rates of parental yelling which we view as a key indicator of an authoritarian style of parenting. We review parenting advice offered by conservative Protestant elites, who articulate child-rearing schemata grounded in both religious and psychological rationales for the discipline of youngsters. Notably, conservative Protestant family specialists advocate corporal punishment while discouraging the parental use of yelling at children. Data drawn from the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) indicate that conservative Protestant parents of preschoolers and school-age children are significantly less likely to report yelling at their children. Moreover, the estimated effects of denominational affiliation on the parental use of yelling are partly mediated by conservative theological views. We conclude by calling for research that analyzes the effects of the distinctive conservative Protestant approach to discipline on child well-being.

AB  - The adaptive nature of bone lies in its ability to respond to the environment by conforming and reshaping itself constantly to accommodate life-time stresses experienced throughout daily activities. In order to keep strains within the bone as uniform and isotropic as possible, the trabecular orientation is determined by forces acting on the bone through adaptive remodeling. Hence, the preserved structure of bones may contain direct information about the forces they may have undergone. Some authors (Correnti [1952], Atti Acc Naz Lincei 12:518-523, [1955] Riv Antrop 42:289-336; Macchiarelli et al. [1999] J Hum Evol 36:211-232, [2001] Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press) have described in detail the trabecular systems of the hip bone in different primate species and have identified a gait-related system above the acetabulum with substantial differences across species (Macchiarelli et al. [1999]; Rook et al. [1999] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:8875-8879). The aim of this study was to quantify trabecular orientation above the acetabulum to test the hypothesis that hominoid biomechanical behavior is recorded in the cancellous bone. The pelvic bones of 23 archaeological adult modern humans (12 females, 11 males), 20 adult Pan troglodytes (10 females, 10 males), and one adult male Neanderthal were radiographed and digitized. Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of the regions of interest in the corpus of the ilium were performed, with the angular distribution of the trabeculae quantified. All species displayed a constant and periodic orthogonal arrangement in the trabeculae with differences in the pattern of dominance between the arcades oriented along the 0 degrees or the 90 degrees axes. The variation in the FFT spectrum between species is discussed in the light of distinctive biomechanical features.

AB  - The current study examined factors associated with adolescent and parent participation in a coping skills intervention for adolescent girls with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and examined factors associated with attrition related to intermittent missing data. Thirty-one adolescent girls with IBD and their parents enrolled in the intervention. Psychosocial and disease factors related to participation in the 6-week web component of the coping skills intervention were examined as were baseline group differences between those who provided post-treatment data and those who did not. Adolescents experiencing more difficulties related to their disease and psychosocial functioning participated less in the web component of the treatment intervention. Families who attrited had higher baseline levels of parental catastrophic thoughts, parenting stress, and adolescent depression. Families experiencing greater levels of psychological and disease-related difficulties may be at risk for low participation and eventual dropout from pediatric IBD psychological treatment interventions The current study examined factors associated with adolescent and parent participation in a coping skills intervention for adolescent girls with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and examined factors associated with attrition related to intermittent missing data.

AB  - Doppler ultrasound is widely used in medical applications to extract the blood Doppler flow velocity in the arteries via spectral analysis. The spectral analysis of non-stationary signals and particularly Doppler signals requires adequate tools that should present both good time and frequency resolutions. It is well-known that the most commonly used time-windowed Fourier transform, which provides a time-frequency representation, is limited by the intrinsic trade-off between time and frequency resolutions. Parametric methods have then been introduced as an alternative to overcome this resolution problem. However, the performance of those methods deteriorates when high non-stationarities are present in the Doppler signal. For the purpose of accurately estimating the Doppler frequency shift, even when the temporal flow velocity is rapid (high non-stationarity), we propose to combine the use of the time-varying autoregressive (AR) method and the (dominant) pole frequency. This proposed method performs well in the context where non-stationarities are very high. A comparative evaluation has been made between classical (FFT based) and AR (both block and recursive) algorithms. Among recursive algorithms we test an adaptive recursive method as well as a time-varying recursive method. Finally, the superiority of the time-varying parametric approach in terms of frequency tracking and delay in the frequency estimate is illustrated for both simulated and in vivo Doppler signals Doppler ultrasound is widely used in medical applications to extract the blood Doppler flow velocity in the arteries via spectral analysis.

AB  - Many techniques derived from various family therapies such as filial therapy (Stover & Guerney, 1967), conjugal therapy (Ely, 1970), conjoint parent/child therapy (Wertheim, 1959), conjoint marital therapy (Haley, 1963; Satir, 1964, 1965), and conjoint family therapy (Satir, 1964, 1965) have recently been incorporated into the practice skills repertory of clinical social workers. Of all of these approaches the behavioral view has a substantial pool of accumulated data to support its wide use in practice (Jacobson & Martin, 1976). However, virtually no detailed explanation of the behavioral view appears in the social work literature, thus hindering its application.

AB  - Covariance estimation for high dimensional signals is a classically difficult problem in statistical signal analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel non-linear sparsity constraint. More specifically, the covariance is constrained to have an eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efficiently estimated using greedy optimization of the log-likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efficiently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is generally positive definite and well-conditioned, even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on a combination of simulated data, standard hyperspectral data, and face image sets show that the SMT-based covariance estimates are consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. An important property of the new covariance estimate is that it naturally yields a fast implementation of the estimated eigen-transformation using the SMT representation. In fact, the SMT can be viewed as a generalization of the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) in that it uses "butterflies" to represent an orthonormal transform. However, unlike the FFT, the SMT can be used for fast eigen-signal analysis of general non-stationary signals Covariance estimation for high dimensional signals is a classically difficult problem in statistical signal analysis and machine learning.

AB  - Introduction: Our aimwas to conduct sleep analysis of human patients with profound post-lingual deafness who had been successfully implanted with intra-cochlear devices, in order to find further support for the hypothesis that auditory input has effects on sleep organization. Methods: Nine post-lingual deaf patients (age range 19-65 y.o.) were included in this study. Four of them had been implanted with multichannel cochlear implant devices two years prior to this study, with successful hearing results. Each implanted patient was recorded as their own control, thus allowing assessment of the experimental condition (implant ON) and its control (implant OFF) in the same patient. A standard polysomnographic (PSG) studywas carried out considering stages I, II, III-IV and paradoxical sleep (PS). In addition, two temporal leads (T3 and T4) were placed on the scalp for EEG frequency domain analysis using the Fast-Fourier Transform(FFT) during the different sleep stages, with the implant either ON or OFF. The student t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results and Conclusions: (1) The four patients analyzed with the implant ON - allowing night noise listening - showed shifts in sleep percentages, exhibiting a significant decrease in stage II, an increase in stages III-IV and also a significant PS percentage decrease. (2) The FFT analysis of T3 and T4 leads showed power shifts in all patients -implant ON vs. implant OFF - although in a different manner showing great disparities. A possible explanation for the power band diverse behavior may be technical regarding the electrode positioning both over the scalp and in the cochlea. (3) Five deaf subjects, without any implant, did not show differences in sleep stages percentages in comparison with normal hearing persons. A profound post-lingual deaf person suffers changes in the organization of their central auditory networks that could affect other networks determining changes in sleep organization. After a successful intra-cochlear implant, the hearing recovery would produce the reorganization of the networks, introducing changes in sleep architecture Introduction: Our aimwas to conduct sleep analysis of human patients with profound post-lingual deafness who had been successfully implanted with intra-cochlear devices, in order to find further support for the hypothesis that auditory input has effects on sleep organization.

AB  - Spectral methods for the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiograms (ECG) are believed to require visual verification and manual editing of the computerised recognition of the ECG. This study investigated the effect of the recognition errors of computerised ECG recognition on two methods providing spectral HRV indices: (a) Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); and (b) peak-to-trough analysis (PTA). Both methods were used to measure HRV spectra in 24-h ECGs recorded in 557 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Each ECG was analysed using the Marquette 8000 Holter system and spectral HRV analyses were performed both prior to and after manual verification of the automatic ECG analysis. The FFT and PTA methods were used to calculate the low (0.04-0.15 Hz), medium (0.15-0.40 Hz) and high (0.40-1.00 Hz) HRV spectral components. For each method and for each spectral component, the rank correlations between the results obtained from unedited and edited ECG recognition were calculated. The correlations between the corresponding spectral components provided by the FFT and PTA methods applied to the edited recognitions were also calculated. Both methods were substantially affected by recognition errors. The FFT method was more sensitive to the misrecognition than the PTA method. The inter-method correlations were higher for the high and medium spectral components than for the low spectral component. The study suggests that spectral HRV analysis should be performed only on carefully verified and manually corrected recognitions of long-term electrocardiograms Spectral methods for the assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiograms (ECG) are believed to require visual verification and manual editing of the computerised recognition of the ECG.

AB  - The main objectives were to evaluate efficacy and acceptability of a developmentally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-based school refusal in adolescence. Twenty school-refusing adolescents meeting DSM-IV anxiety disorder criteria participated in a non-randomized trial, together with parents and school staff. Outcome was assessed at post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. Treated adolescents showed significant and maintained improvements across primary outcome variables (school attendance; school-related fear; anxiety), with medium to large effect sizes. Half of the adolescents were free of any anxiety disorder at follow-up. Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy). The treatment was rated as acceptable by adolescents, parents, and school staff, which may help explain the very low attrition rate. Social anxiety disorder was the most common disorder among adolescents still meeting anxiety disorder criteria at follow-up. Treatment modifications to improve efficacy for school-refusing adolescents presenting with social anxiety disorder are suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present here the results concerning the antibacterial properties evaluation of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene, compared with its constitutive monomer, the para-guanidinoethylphenol, and hexamidine (Hexomedine (R)), an antiseptic from the diamidine family widely used in therapeutic, chosen as a reference in this study for its resemblance in terms of functional groups. Antibacterial activities of those three compounds were evaluated by microdilution methods, in Mueller Hinton broth, onto 5 bacterial strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 & ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, according to CA-SFM and CLSI (formerly NCCLS) approved standards. In parallel, the effects of these three compounds on MRC-5 eukaryotic cell viability were evaluated with MTT assay. The results obtained here confirm a lack of activity for the monomer compound (MIC >= 512 mg/l) and a real antibacterial activity for the calixarene, comparable to hexamidine. This activity is expressed, both on Gram + and Gram- bacteria (MIC = 4 mg/l for E. coli, 8 mg/l on both S. aureus strains) and at a lesser degree on E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa (MIC = 32 mg/l). Similarly, both compounds, monomer and calixarene, slightly induce any modification on MRC-5 cells viability, and this until 168 h of treatment for concentrations reaching 10(-4) mol/L while hexamidine demonstrates a significant and increasing effect during the time of experiment and this for 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations. Thus, this study tends to confirm the significance of the organization of the para-guanidinoethylphenol monomer into its cyclic calixarenic tetramer for the gain of an antibacterial activity, similar to a widely used antiseptic one.

AB  - Patient satisfaction with treatment sheds light on the acceptability, disseminability and usefulness of treatments. This study aimed to assess the perspectives of families who completed treatment using a manual-driven family-based treatment for anorexia nervosa. We hypothesized that overall, manualized treatment would be viewed as acceptable and helpful, but that none the less, a proportion of patients would identify a wish for other types or additional therapy. A total of thirty-four families participated in the survey. Results suggest that patients and families viewed the treatment as highly effective and acceptable. However, approximately a quarter suggested that individual therapy, more family therapy, and focusing on other issues besides anorexia nervosa would improve treatment. These data suggest that a manual-driven family-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa is acceptable to adolescents and their parents, though modifications to include additional therapy and individual therapy might be considered in some cases.

In the student sample, both neediness and connectedness were related to depression severity; however, the association was stronger for neediness. No relation was found between these personality scales and symptom severity in the clinical sample. Differences between neediness and connectedness emerged in their relationship to personality and attachment style. In both samples, neediness was predictive of a more psychopathological personality profile and attachment style than was connectedness. The results support the argument that DEQ connectedness assesses a less maladaptive form of dependency than does neediness.

AB  - This paper investigates the valuation of currency options when the underlying currency follows a mean-reverting lognormal process with multi-scale stochastic volatility. A closed-form solution is derived for the characteristic function of the log-asset price. European options are then valued by means of the Fourier inversion formula. The proposed model enables us to calibrate simultaneously to the observed currency futures and the implied volatility surface of the currency options within a unified framework. The fractional fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted to implement the Fourier inversion, thus ensuring that the grid spacing restriction of the standard FFT can be relaxed, which results in a more efficient computation. Using Monte Carlo simulation as a benchmark, our numerical examples show that the derived option pricing formula is accurate and efficient for practical use. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Electroencephalographic data were collected to investigate the effects of selective attention on visual evoked potential (VEP) responses to contrast-modulated flicker. VEP amplitude was determined by Fourier analysis (FFT) of steady-state flicker epochs. Attention was controlled by a psychophysical task in which the subject was required to detect a faint isoluminant chromatic change in the attended target. Two types of visual target sets were employed. First, while the subject foveated on a central fixation-point, attention was directed either to an eccentric flickering wedge or to the fixation-point itself For every target set of this type, in the Attend-Fixation-Point condition, VEP amplitude was reduced to the level of noise in the spectral band surrounding the stimulus-driven frequency or was substantially attenuated. The second type of target set comprised a flickering wedge and an offset non-flickering wedge, both at an eccentric location in the visual field. For target sets of this type, comprising small flickering stimuli 0.36 x 0.36 degree of visual angle (v.a.) in size, separated by as little as 0.36 degree v.a. in the right visual hemifield, VEP amplitude was again reduced to the level of noise or substantially attenuated in the Attend-Nonflickering-Target condition. Small separated target sets in the left visual hemifield and small adjacent target sets in both visual hemifields showed less consistent attentional effects. Contrast response functions obtained from small separated target sets in the right visual hemifield evidenced a nearly linear increase of VEP amplitude for contrasts up to 25%, with saturation at higher contrasts. A variety of temporal flicker frequencies were tested, and all VEP responses obtained were in the beta bandwidth, whether at the fundamental flicker frequency, the second, or third harmonic. Attentional effects were replicated in both the contrast and frequency response experiments, and high resolution eye-tracking data demonstrated no differences in visual fixation between attentional conditions. Results demonstrated an absence of spatial gradients of attention above the threshold of perception. The slope and half-saturation values of the contrast response curves indicate that magnocellular pathways in V1 and V2 were the primary cortical areas involved in the VEP responses silenced by selective attention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairments compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been used in the clinical setting with the aim of improving the overall functional outcome for these infants. However, the benefit of these programs remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of early developmental intervention post-discharge from hospital for preterm (< 37 weeks) infants on motor or cognitive development. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Neonatal Review group search strategy was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE Advanced, CINAHL, PsychINFO and EMBASE (1966 through February 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programs that commenced within the first 12 months of life for infants born at < 37 weeks with no major congenital abnormalities. Intervention could commence as an inpatient; however, a post discharge component was necessary to be included in this review. The outcome measures were not pre-specified other than that they had to assess cognitive and/or motor ability. The rates of intellectual impairment, cerebral palsy and development co-ordination disorder were also documented. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted and entered by two independent review authors. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled in three age groups - infant (0 to 2 years), preschool (3 to < 5 years) or school age (5 to 17 years). Meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 4.2 to determine the effects of early developmental intervention in the short (0 to 2 years), medium (3 to < 5 years) and long term (5 to 17 years). Subgroup analysis was carried out in relation to; gestational age, birthweight, brain injury, commencement of intervention, focus of intervention and study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2379 randomised patients). Six of these studies were RCTs and had strong methodological quality. There was variability with regard to the focus and intensity of the intervention, and in length of follow-up. Meta-analysis concluded that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient [DQ]: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.46 SD; 95% CI 0.36 0.57; P < 0.0001), and at preschool age (intelligence quotient [IQ]; SMD 0.46 SD; 95%CI 0.33, 0.59; P < 0.0001). However, this effect was not sustained at school age (IQ; SMD 0.02 SD; 95% CI -0.10, 0.14; P = 0.71). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infant and school ages. There was little evidence of an effect of early intervention on motor outcomes in the short, medium or long-term, but there were only two studies reporting outcomes beyond 2 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention programs for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive outcomes in the short to medium term. However, there was significant heterogeneity between the interventions included in this review. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programs. Cost-effectiveness and access to services should also be evaluated since they are important factors when considering implementation of an early developmental intervention program for a preterm infant. EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS POST HOSPITAL DISCHARGE TO PREVENT MOTOR AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN PRETERM INFANTS: Preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) are at risk of development problems, including problems with cognitive and motor development. Cognitive development refers to thinking and learning ability and motor development refers to the way infants move, such as sitting, crawling and walking. Early developmental interventions aim to reduce cognitive and/ or motor problems; however, the benefits of these programs are not clear. A review of trials suggests early developmental intervention programs post discharge from hospital for preterm infants are effective at improving cognitive development in the short to medium term (up to preschool age). There is limited evidence that early developmental interventions improve motor outcome or long term cognitive outcome (up to school age). The early developmental intervention programs in this review had to commence within the first 12 months of life, focus on the parent-infant relationship and/or infant development and, although they could commence while the baby was still in hospital, they had to have a component that was delivered post-discharge from hospital. The early developmental intervention programs included in this review are different in content, frequency of intervention and focus of intervention. The variability in the intervention programs limits the conclusions that can be made about the effectiveness of early developmental interventions BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairments compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been used in the clinical setting with the aim of improving the overall functional outcome for these infants. However, the benefit of these programs remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of early developmental intervention post-discharge from hospital for preterm (< 37 weeks) infants on motor or cognitive development. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Neonatal Review group search strategy was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE Advanced, CINAHL, PsychINFO and EMBASE (1966 through February 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programs that commenced within the first 12 months of life for infants born at < 37 weeks with no major congenital abnormalities. Intervention could commence as an inpatient; however, a post discharge component was necessary to be included in this review. The outcome measures were not pre-specified other than that they had to assess cognitive and/or motor ability. The rates of intellectual impairment, cerebral palsy and development co-ordination disorder were also documented. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted and entered by two independent review authors. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled in three age groups - infant (0 to 2 years), preschool (3 to < 5 years) or school age (5 to 17 years). Meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 4.2 to determine the effects of early developmental intervention in the short (0 to 2 years), medium (3 to < 5 years) and long term (5 to 17 years). Subgroup analysis was carried out in relation to; gestational age, birthweight, brain injury, commencement of intervention, focus of intervention and study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2379 randomised patients). Six of these studies were RCTs and had strong methodological quality. There was variability with regard to the focus and intensity of the intervention, and in length of follow-up. Meta-analysis concluded that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient [DQ]: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.46 SD; 95% CI 0.36 0.57; P < 0.0001), and at preschool age (intelligence quotient [IQ]; SMD 0.46 SD; 95%CI 0.33, 0.59; P < 0.0001). However, this effect was not sustained at school age (IQ; SMD 0.02 SD; 95% CI -0.10, 0.14; P = 0.71). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infant and school ages. There was little evidence of an effect of early intervention on motor outcomes in the short, medium or long-term, but there were only two studies reporting outcomes beyond 2 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention programs for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive outcomes in the short to medium term. However, there was significant heterogeneity between the interventions included in this review. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programs.

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly accepted as a feasible and safe therapeutic alternative to open heart surgery in select patients. Procedural success and technological advances combined with favorable clinical outcomes and demonstrated prolonged survival are establishing TAVR as the standard of care in symptomatic patients who are at higher risk or not candidates for conventional surgery. The growing number of referrals and complexities of care of TAVR candidates warrants a program that ensures appropriate patient assessment and triage, establishes appropriate processes, and promotes continuity of care. To address these needs and prepare for the anticipated growth of transcatheter heart valve (THV) therapeutic options, the TAVR program at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada, implemented an electronic centralized and clinically managed referral and triage program, and a THV Nurse Coordinator position to support the program and patients, conduct a global functioning assessment, and provide clinical triage coordination, waitlist management, patient and family education and communication with clinicians. Interdisciplinary rounds assist in the selection of candidates, while a clinical data management system facilitates standardized documentation and quality assurance from referral to follow-up.

AB  - Behavioral psychologists have developed effective methods of treatment for overeating and weight control, including mealtime regulation, avoidance of taboo foods, and removal of identified precursors to the bingeing behavior. The current study sought to examine the relationship between speed of eating and levels of satiation in weight conscious individuals. Ten participants were instructed to eat at a fast and a slow rate in a within-subjects reversal design. Consuming food at a slow rate helped participants achieve satiation quicker with comparable amounts of food intake. Slow eaters were also less likely to overeat. These results suggest that slow eating may prevent excessive food consumption in weight conscious individuals, constituting an effective means of weight management.

AB  - This study focuses on the extent to which receiving physically abusive punishment and witnessing violence by a family member increases the likelihood of later delinquency. Data for this presentation were drawn from the National Survey of Adolescents in the United States. Information was collected through interviews with a national probability telephone sample of 4,023 juveniles ages 12-17 and their parents or guardians. Sex, age, race, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and income were controlled for. Using censored regression, I found that sex, age, PTSD and physically abusive punishment all had a significant relationship with delinquency, while race and witnessing family violence were shown to be nonsignificant in this model. This analysis is particularly important because, not only does physical abuse lead to emotional and psychological damage, but it also is a marker for increased delinquent behavior in adolescents. These results suggest a number of important policy implications surrounding the effects of child abuse. Programs aimed at new parents that offer parenting skills, child care opportunities, and support services can be effective in improving parenting and thus reduce the likelihood of abuse. Early intervention or prevention of abuse is the key. Later intervention should not be ignored, however. Programs such as multi-systemic therapy and family functional therapy have shown success in bringing families together to resolve such issues. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

An additional 15 couples were recruited as a non-ISD comparison sample. Only very modest treatment and control group differences were found after treatment. Females treated with marital therapy made significant gains on one measure of sexual desire and on level of depressive symptomatology. Overall, the marital treatment group seemed to make clinically significant gains from pre- to posttreatment which were largely maintained at follow-up. Lower levels of initial marital distress resulted in greater treatment gains, and better pretreatment marital adjustment predicted better posttreatment overall sexual adjustment.

AB  - Medical non-adherence is multifactorial: cost, convenience, side effect profile, and cognitive impairment are all implicated in medical non-adherence. We explore impaired executive function (EF) as a cause for medical non-adherence when other causes can be ruled out. EF describes the coordination and manipulation of higher-order cognitive processes involved in problem-solving, planning, and decision-making. EF has three components: working memory, mental flexibility, and inhibitory control. The latter, inhibitory control, when impaired will affect an individual's ability to make choices to produce long-term benefits, in favor of short-term gratification. When applied to adults with chronic diseases, like diabetes, that require lifestyle modification and, at times, complicated medical regimens to forestall long term complications, an intact EF has a role in adherence. EF development is protracted with behavioral corollaries observable from early childhood. Thus, teachers, family physicians, and pediatricians will be the professionals to first encounter and manage such individuals. We suggest screening tests for children in the doctor's office to detect impaired EF, and postulate a cognitive behavioral therapeutic approach for adults with uncontrolled DM and impaired EF.

AB  - Shortly following the Second World War, and under the medical direction of ex-army psychiatrist T. F. Main, the Cassel Hospital for Functional Nervous Disorders emerged as a pioneering democratic 'therapeutic community' in the treatment of mental illness. This definitive movement away from conventional 'custodial' assumptions about the function of the psychiatric hospital initially grew out of a commitment to sharing therapeutic responsibility between patients and staff and to preserving patients' pre-admission responsibilities and social identities. However, by the mid-1950s, hospital practices had come to focus pre-eminently on patients' relationships with family members, and staff had developed a social model of mental health that focused on the family as the irreducible unit of mental treatment. By the late 1950s, this culminated in the in-patient admission of entire families for mental treatment, even when only one family member was exhibiting symptoms. At the heart of this growing post-war social-psychiatric preoccupation with the family was a new emphasis on the close relationship between mental health and individuals' successful development toward mature responsible adulthood. The family came to be conceived as the quintessential space where both were forged. This article examines the process through which the Cassel's social-psychiatric commitment to 'therapeutic community' became focused on the family as a key therapeutic site. While the family had become a central point of focus in social, political and psychological discussions of the foundation for stable democratic culture and political peace in post-war Britain, the Cassel Hospital actively experimented with these connections in therapeutic practice. This article thus illuminates the important, but frequently overlooked, role of psychiatric practices in the development of a post-war psychopolitics that established important links between the nuclear family, mental health and democratic social life Shortly following the Second World War, and under the medical direction of ex-army psychiatrist T.

AB  - The combined use of architectural and stress technologies in osteological studies is starting to provide the basic biomechanical underpinnings to both evolutionary and applied medical investigations of bone. The architectural investigations, though tested using invasive methods, are aimed at non-invasive ways of obtaining information from radiographs of bones, fossils and people. They include optical (Fourier) data analysis (ODA) and computational Fourier transformations (FFT). The stress studies, though initially involving older techniques such as photoelastic stress analysis, now employ finite element analysis (FEA) and, most recently, fast Lagrangian analysis of continua (FLAC). Taken together, these methods are capable of providing more detailed knowledge of bone form and function that is important (a) in revealing functional adaptation in evolutionary studies of fossils and (b) for making early diagnosis and understanding pathological fractures in the late stages of osteoporosis.

AB  - Background. The methods for evaluating dental implant osseointegration can be limited in their effectiveness. The authors developed a new noninvasive electronic instrument to test implant stability and improve the assessment process Methods. Using the new instrument, which was based on impulse testing and fast Fourier transform, or FFT, technology, the authors tested implant stability under real-time clinical conditions. The clinical procedure involved a weekly test of two placed implants, from the first-stage insertion point to the completion of the integration. This longitudinal monitoring spanned eight months Results. The authors verified clinical implant integration electronically and that it closely matched mathematical predictions. They also observed changes in implant stability during the integration process Conclusions. Implant stability can be monitored electronically using FFT testing. A theoretical integration prediction also can be formulated. Like a "dental electrocardiogram," integration is assessed by waveform shape analysis Clinical Implications. Electronic measurement of implant stability may help clinicians noninvasively diagnose the suitability of implants for restoration and aid in postrestorative monitoring Background.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between personality structure and brain activity of individuals while resting with eyes closed. In the experiment 110 individuals participated (55 males and 55 females). They were clustered into 5 personality types according to the dimensions of general and emotional intelligence, and the five-factor personality model (FFM)--extraversion (E), neuroticism (N), openness (O), conscientiousness (C) and agreeableness (A). The resting EEG of individuals was analyzed using three methods: a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); Approximated entropy (ApEn), and a low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The results show that most robust differences between personality types were observed in the gamma band, between types with extreme constellations of dimensions (neurotic type - low emotional intelligence and A; high N), or between types with specific combinations of dimensions (introverts with high IQ, versus extraverts with low to average IQ). These differences were also gender specific. In the gamma band females with different personality structures differed much more than did males, whereas in the lower-1 alpha band a reverse pattern was observed. It was further shown that the differences were much more pronounced in the parieto-occipital brain areas than in the frontal areas.

AB  - The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that varying sensory input can affect mood, autonomic arousal, and electrocortical activity. Twenty right-handed males were exposed to three rhythmic audio-visual stimulation programs, with either a high intensity and variety of stimuli (program H), a low stimulation (program L) or with a transient from high to low (program HL). Multichannel EEG, heart rate, and skin conductance were recorded continuously, and after each trial mood was rated on a bipolar adjective list. EEG data were subjected to FFT dipole approximation procedure, and dipole locations and field strength (Global Field Power) were analyzed for the frequency bands theta, alpha, and beta 1. Mood ratings clearly differed between programs H and HL, with highest values of arousal after H. Programs L and HL decreased autonomic arousal, whereas H induced deactivating as well as activating effects. Field strength of the alpha band decreased similarly during all programs. Dipole sources were located more to the left in the alpha band and more to the right in the beta 1 band during all programs as compared with baseline. Therefore, programs affected mood and autonomic variables differently, but not electrocortical variables. The higher activation of the right hemisphere during all programs is interpreted as an indication that audio-visual stimulation does induce changes in the brain, such as are commonly found in altered states of consciousness The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that varying sensory input can affect mood, autonomic arousal, and electrocortical activity.

AB  - Child analysis and child psychotherapy require constant attention to intrapsychic and intrafamilial processes. Bion's theories regarding unconscious functioning within groups are particularly useful for understanding progressive and regressive shifts within families. The concepts of work group and basic assumption modes in family groups are examined, as are group mentality and group culture. Clinical examples of work with parents of children in analysis and analytic therapy utilizing these concepts are provided. It is suggested that attention to the unconscious relations within a family can elucidate the unconscious object relations observed in children in treatment Child analysis and child psychotherapy require constant attention to intrapsychic and intrafamilial processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the complaint of unrefreshing sleep with study of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with chronic fatigue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen successively seen patients (mean age: 41.1 9.8) who complained of chronic fatigue but denied sleepiness and agreed to participate were compared to 14 controls (33.6+/-10.2 years) who were monitored during sleep recorded in parallel. After performing conventional sleep scoring we applied Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) for the delta 1, delta 2, theta, alpha, sigma 1, sigma 2, beta EEG frequency bands. The presence of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep instability was studied with calculation of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) rate. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze FFT results and Mann-Whitney U-test to compare CAP rate in both groups of subjects. RESULTS: Slow wave sleep (SWS) percentage and sleep efficiency were lower, but there was a significant increase in delta 1 (slow delta) relative power in the chronic fatigue group when compared to normals (P<0.01). All the other frequency bands were proportionally and significantly decreased compared to controls. CAP rate was also significantly greater in subjects with chronic fatigue than in normals (P=0.04). An increase in respiratory effort and nasal flow limitation were noted with chronic fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The complaints of chronic fatigue and unrefreshing sleep were associated with an abnormal CAP rate, with increase in slow delta power spectrum, affirming the presence of an abnormal sleep progression and NREM sleep instability. These specific patterns were related to subtle, undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the complaint of unrefreshing sleep with study of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with chronic fatigue.
