AB  - QUESTION: Does cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), functional family therapy (FFT), combined FFT and CBT, or a group psychoeducational intervention reduce adolescent substance abuse? Design Randomised (unclear allocation concealment*), unblinded*, controlled trial with 7 months of follow up Setting A university centre in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA Patients 120 adolescents who were 13-17 years of age (mean age 16 y, 80% boys), lived at home with a primary caretaker willing to participate in the study, and met DSM-IV criteria for a primary substance abuse disorder (primarily illicit drug use). Exclusion criteria were need for services beyond outpatient treatment, evidence of a psychotic or organic state, or a sibling in the study. Follow up was 88% at 4 months and 89% at 7 months Intervention Adolescents were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: FFT (n=30), individual CBT (n=31), combined FFT and CBT (n=29), or a group intervention (n=30). FFT consisted of 12 weekly sessions of a systems oriented, behaviouralty based family therapy with 2 phases: engaging families in treatment and enhancing motivation for change, and implementing behavioural changes in the family. Individual CBT consisted of motivational enhancement (2 sessions) and skills modules (10 sessions), including communication training, problem solving, peer refusal, and relapse prevention. The joint intervention consisted of weekly sessions of FFT and individual CBT The group intervention provided education about substance abuse and its treatment and prevention (eight 90 min sessions) Main outcome measure Proportion of youths achieving minimal use (ie, use on < 10% of the days reported using the Timeline follow back interview) Main results A 4 x 3 repeated measures analysis of variance was done. At 4 months after treatment, FFT; joint FFT and CBT, and CBT alone showed reductions in adolescent marijuana use. At 7 months after treatment, FFT alone, joint FIT and CBT, and the group intervention showed reductions in marijuana use. When die FFT and joint conditions were combined for analysis, more adolescents in the combined family conditions than in the group condition changed from heavy to minimal marijuana use at 4 months (p < 0.013) but the difference was not statistically significant at 7 months (p < 0.128) (table). Combined family therapy plus CBT was better than CBT alone for increasing minimal use in adolescents at 7 months (p < 0.028) but the difference was not statistically significant at 4 months (table) Conclusion In adolescents with substance abuse, family based therapy, particularly in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy, showed better treatment outcomes for adolescents at 7 months after treatment *See glossary QUESTION: Does cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), functional family therapy (FFT), combined FFT and CBT, or a group psychoeducational intervention reduce adolescent substance abuse?

Methods: Our sample consisted of 187 adolescents who were arrested during or following participation in FFT treatment. Results: The number of sessions correlated with the number of days that elapsed after intake to the first post-intake arrest. Conclusions: In an urban minority sample with many risk factors, clinicians need to be especially sensitive to adolescent cannabis use, other substance use, and association with deviant peers, adherence, and the Engagement/Motivation phase of FFT therapy Objectives: (1) identify risk factors associated with premature treatment drop-out (2) examine the relationship between number of sessions and time to arrest.

AB  - There is a dearth of research examining treatment engagement and attendance among runaway youth and their families. Such research is needed in order to inform treatment providers on factors associated with engagement and maintenance of these difficult to engage families into counseling. This study examined differential treatment attendance for alcohol abusing runaway youth residing at a local shelter. A traditional office-based family systems approach, Functional Family Therapy (FFT), was compared to a non-traditional, home-based, multisystemic family therapy approach, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT). As expected, treatment engagement and attendance was significantly higher for those assigned to EBFT (N = 37) compared to FFT (N = 40). Predictors of treatment attendance (income, family chaos, externalization problems and level of youth substance use) were examined within each treatment modality. Findings suggest that home-based (compared to office-based) treatment modalities may significantly increase treatment attendance and engagement of runaway youth and their families. Non-traditional forms of treatment may need to be considered in order to best meet the needs of highly chaotic and disorganized family systems. Copyright <ef><bf><bd> 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

AB  - Adolescence is a unique time period in an individual's life, one in which suicide and substance abuse become substantial health risks. Currently, suicide accounts for approximately 14% of all deaths among 15-24 year olds in the U.S.A. Drug, alcohol abuse and dependence are the most prevalent causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality in the USA. Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between adolescent alcohol, substance abuse and suicide. When compared to community controls, the rate of a substance abuse disorder was 8.5 times higher in a sample of adolescent suicide completers and the rate of alcohol abuse was 7.5 times higher. Genetic and biological variables may also be responsible for either alcohol and substance abuse or suicide or both alcohol and substance abuse and suicide. There is little empirical research evaluating the effectiveness of alcohol and substance abuse treatments for adolescents. Therapies such as multisystemic therapy, functional family therapy, motivational interviewing, community reinforcement, the 12-step approach and contingency management reinforcement seem to be effective treatments. Despite the strong association between adolescent alcohol and substance use and suicidal behaviors, few studies have investigated the combined treatment of these two issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy, seems to be a promising psychotherapy treatment for suicidality in alcohol and substance abusing adolescents.

AB  - This study examined treatment outcomes of 86 highly acculturated Hispanic and Anglo substance-abusing adolescents in functional family therapy, testing the hypothesis that ethnic matching of therapist and client is related to better treatment outcomes for clients. Adolescents reported on their substance use pre- and posttreatment on a timeline follow-back interview. Ethnically matched Hispanic adolescents demonstrated greater decreases in their substance use compared with Hispanic adolescents with Anglo therapists. Ethnic match status was not related to treatment outcome for Anglo clients. Thus, the matching hypothesis was supported for Hispanic clients only. The results underscore the importance of greater ethnic diversity among therapists and better cultural competency training for Anglo therapists. More research is needed on individual differences in the effects of ethnic matching.

Therapeutic alliances of mothers, fathers, and adolescents were assessed from videotapes of the 1st treatment session for 43 Hispanic and 43 Anglo families. Hispanic families who dropped out before completing the requisite number of sessions were found to have greater imbalance in alliance (parent-adolescent) than those who did complete therapy. However, this finding was not replicated with Anglo families.

AB  - This study is designed to examine in-session therapeutic processes that contribute to engagement and retention in family therapy with drug abusing adolescents. In particular, this study examines common therapist interventions and core family processes that predict failure to engage (i.e., family drop outs prior to sessions 4) and failure to retain (i.e., family drop outs after session 4-7) in treatment. It is hypothesize that for families that engage in therapy, therapist Support and Cognitive Restructuring interventions will lead to increased family Alliance and decreased Conflict/Negativity respectively. It is further hypothesized that for families that retain in therapy, therapist Directive interventions will lead to increases in family Parenting. Families will be selected from the archives of three established family therapy programs (Functional Family Therapy; Multidimensional Family Therapy; Structural; Family Therapy). Common therapist interventions and core family processes will be identified from codings (microsession) and ratings (macrosession) of videotaped sessions. Preliminary confirmatory factor analyses will be conduced to examine the factor, structure of the common therapist interventions and core family processes.

AB  - Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is a therapeutic intervention that aims to prevent and reduce delinquency by changing intra-family members' dynamics. Preliminary results of an FFT evaluation in New Jersey are presented. The research employs a matched comparison group design to compare FFT participants (N=40) in the Children at Risk Resources and Interventions - Youth Intensive Intervention Program (CARRI-YIIP), with a comparison group (N=40) that received traditional group and individual therapeutic interventions via Youth Case Management (YCM). Most FFT and comparison youth were court-ordered to participate and/or on probation. The relative success of the two interventions is measured by a Strengths and Needs Assessment which includes information on child's life domain functioning, children's and caregivers' strengths, and children's behavioral and emotional needs and risks. Recidivism of the experimental group is indicated by new delinquency or adult criminal charges. Finally, the results of a qualitative assessment of FFT intervention and program satisfaction survey among participants and their families are described ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - In this study, the authors examined the role of balance between adolescent-therapist and parent-therapist alliances in the retention of functional family therapy clients. Therapeutic alliances of mothers, fathers, and adolescents were assessed from videotapes of the 1st treatment session for 43 Hispanic and 43 Anglo families. Hispanic families who dropped out before completing the requisite number of sessions were found to have greater imbalance in alliance (parent-adolescent) than those who did complete therapy. However, this finding was not replicated with Anglo families. Results are interpreted in terms of previous research on family-level balanced alliance effects.

AB  - This study examined treatment outcomes of 86 highly acculturated Hispanic and Anglo substance-abusing adolescents in functional family therapy, testing the hypothesis that ethnic matching of therapist and client is related to better treatment outcomes for clients. Adolescents reported on their substance use pre- and posttreatment on a timeline follow-back interview. Ethnically matched Hispanic adolescents demonstrated greater decreases in their substance use compared with Hispanic adolescents with Anglo therapists. Ethnic match status was not related to treatment outcome for Anglo clients. Thus, the matching hypothesis was supported for Hispanic clients only. The results underscore the importance of greater ethnic diversity among therapists and better cultural competency training for Anglo therapists. More research is needed on individual differences in the effects of ethnic matching.

Research advances include findings that engagement and retention rates for family-based treatments are superior to standard treatment engagement/retention methods. Also, in clinical trials in which they are compared with alternative interventions, in the majority of studies, family-based treatments produce superior and stable outcomes with significant decreases on target symptoms of alcohol and drug use, and related problems such as delinquency, school and family problems, and affiliation with substance abusing peers. Mechanisms of change studies support the theory basis of family-based treatments. For instance, improvements in family interaction patterns coincide with decreases in core target alcohol and drug misuse symptoms.Once in the shadows of the adult substance abuse field, the adolescent substance abuse specialty has become a unique, clinically creative, and empirically-based area.

Participants were 31 Hispanic adolescents and their family members who received brief strategic family therapy for the treatment of adolescent drug use. Videotapes of first sessions were rated to identify parent and adolescent alliances with the therapist. Results demonstrated that Completer cases had significantly higher levels of alliance across all family members than Dropout cases, and Dropout cases had significantly higher unbalanced alliances than Completer cases. Clinical implications are discussed.

One hundred twenty-two youth, 12<ef><bf><bd>_"14 years of age and exhibiting behavior problems, were assigned within a basic one-group pretest/posttest/follow-up design.

This study examined differential treatment at- tendance for alcohol abusing runaway youth residing at a local shelter. A traditional office-based family systems approach, Functional Family Therapy (FFT), was compared to a non-traditional, home-based, multi- systemic family therapy approach, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT). As expected, treatment engagement and attendance was significantly higher for those assigned to EBET (N = 37) compared to FET (N = 40). Predictors of treatment attendance (income, family chaos, externalization problems and level of youth substance use) were examined with- in each treatment modality. Findings suggest that home-based (compared to office-based) treatment modalities may significantly increase treatment attendance and engagement of runaway youth and their families. Non-traditional forms of treatment may need to he considered in order to best meet the needs of highly chaotic and disorganized family systems.

AB  - Administrators of community-based treatment programs are increasingly being required to utilize psychometrically validated instruments to measure the effectiveness of their interventions. However, developers of psychometric measures have often failed to report strategies relevant to the administration of these measures in nontraditional settings outside the therapy office. Moreover, with few exceptions, developers of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) have insufficiently disseminated methods for integrating assessment measures into treatment planning. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review an assessment methodology that may be utilized to support EBT for individuals who are identified for substance abuse or related problem behaviors. The application of this methodology is demonstrated utilizing family behavior therapy to exemplify <e2><80><9c>real world<e2><80><9d> scenarios involving adolescents and adults.

The relational family system is the basis for understanding problems and the primary entry point from which to intervene to change problematic behaviors. FFT also attends to the mutlisystemic context of the family, seeking to target and change individual, family, and contextual risk and protective factors while generalizing, maintaining, and supporting attainable long-term changes. In this chapter, the authors present an overview of the FFT in terms of intervention populations, therapeutic approach, and effectiveness; the history of the development of the integrative model underlying FFT; and a case example.

AB  - (from the chapter) Adolescence is a unique time period in an individual's life, one in which suicide and substance abuse become substantial health risks. Currently, suicide accounts for approximately 14% of all deaths among 15- 24 year olds in the USA. Drug, alcohol abuse and dependence are the most prevalent causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality in the USA. Numerous studies have demonstrated the link between adolescent alcohol, substance abuse and suicide. When compared to community controls, the rate of a substance abuse disorder was 8.5 times higher in a sample of adolescent suicide completers and the rate of alcohol abuse was 7.5 times higher. Genetic and biological variables may also be responsible for either alcohol and substance abuse or suicide or both alcohol and substance abuse and suicide. There is little empirical research evaluating the effectiveness of alcohol and substance abuse treatments for adolescents. Therapies such as multisystemic therapy, functional family therapy, motivational interviewing, community reinforcement, the 12-step approach and contingency management reinforcement seem to be effective treatments. Despite the strong association between adolescent alcohol and substance use and suicidal behaviors, few studies have investigated the combined treatment of these two issues. Cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy, seems to be a promising psychotherapy treatment for suicidality in alcohol and substance abusing adolescents. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of various treatments of alcohol and substance abusing adolescents with suicidal behavior.

AB  - The field of substance misuse intervention has matured considerably in recent years. Compared to the early 1990s, we now have evidence-based interventions for substance involved youth. The best of these interventions, such as Multisystemic Therapy and Functional Family Therapy have a family centered, ecosystemic approach. These developments have been to the good, for many troubled youths, their families, and their surrounding communities. At the same time, a number of unresolved issues remain to be addressed. There is a need to expand community-based treatment services; there is a need for low-cost, evidence-based interventions for drug-misusing youths involving paraprofessionals; treatment infrastructure is in serious need of strengthening and there is need for increased methodological sophistication in evaluating the impact of drug treatment.

AB  - (from the jacket) "Family Therapy for Adolescent Drug Abuse" presents the latest in research and thought on treatment methods for adolescent drug abuse and its connection to family life. This valuable book provides mental health professionals, family therapists, and drug counselors with specific techniques for treating adolescent drug abusers through family therapy. Drawing on myriad cases from their clinical practices as well as from up-to-date research data, the contributors thoroughly explore how adolescent drug abuse is a result of complex underlying problems that often involve the family and how it is inextricably bound to the psychology of adolescence. The volume concludes with detailed descriptions and analyses of family therapy conducted with eight families of adolescent substance abusers, including verbatim transcripts of family therapy sessions with critiques by experienced family therapists. (from the preface) The family is the central focus in virtually all the chapters we have solicited for this collection. It reflects our orientation, which perceives substance-abusing behavior in the adolescent primarily as an aspect of the dysbalanced functioning of his or her family. This view has led us to explore the possibility of enabling the adolescent to overcome his or her substance abuse through family psychotherapy. Several of the chapters, therefore, report the findings of a research project we recently concluded on this matter. . . . Our working hypothesis primarily asserts that helping a family achieve improved functioning enables the adolescent to gain a more socially constructive orientation toward his life experiences--thereby overcoming the impulse to engage in substance abuse and related illicit behaviors. One additional focus of this volume is to give recognition to the importance of scientific research in providing a firm, realistic base to clinical knowledge and procedures in the field of adolescent drug abuse. We recognize that, thus far, the field does not have solid scientific grounding. Our presentations show, however, that much serious and significant work has been accomplished.

AB  - (from the chapter) In this chapter, we present an overview of functional family therapy (FFT). The chapter is written to focus on core theoretical constructs, clinical change mechanisms, and therapist interventions that have led to the positive outcomes reported across outcome studies (for additional information, see, Alexander & Sexton, 2002; Sexton & Alexander, 2002b). We first focus on the dynamic evolution of FFT from an early set of core beliefs to a mature and comprehensive clinical model. Our primary focus will be on the core constructs of how FFT views therapy and understands families and the clinical problems they present, the relational systems of family, and the fundamental change mechanisms that produce positive change. An overview of the outcome research that supports FFT as an effective program and the process research that has uncovered the foundation of the change mechanisms of FFT will follow. We end the chapter with a discussion of the mechanisms of supervision and dissemination and the critical procedures used to measure model fidelity in the various community contexts in which FFT currently "lives."

AB  - (from the cover) Functional Family Therapy is a clinically rich and highly successful approach to working with youth in some of the most difficult clinical populations: adolescents with behavior problems. In Functional family therapy in clinical practice, Thomas Sexton reveals the inside story of the clinical practice of this evidence-based clinical model, considering not only its theoretical model but it's clinical application with diverse cases and clinical settings for youth with drug, behavior, emotional, and mental health problems. He illustrates the application of Functional Family Therapy in both clinical and community settings, and the clinical systems that are needed to successfully transport FFT from the theoretical laboratory to real clinical settings and practice.

Methods: Our sample consisted of 187 adolescents who were arrested during or following participation in FFT treatment. Results: The number of sessions correlated with the number of days that elapsed after intake to the first post-intake arrest. Conclusions: In an urban minority sample with many risk factors, clinicians need to be especially sensitive to adolescent cannabis use, other substance use, and association with deviant peers, adherence, and the Engagement/Motivation phase of FFT therapy.

AB  - (from the chapter) Adolescent substance use disorders (SUDs) encompass a broad spectrum of phenomena involving distinct substances used, a range in quantity and frequency of use, an array of associated problem behaviors, and multiple ecological influences. SUDs are often viewed as just another manifestation of adolescent disruptive behavior. However, the pharmacological effects and physiologically addictive properties of alcohol and illicit drugs have important and unique implications for treatment relative to those for other adolescent disorders. In addition, unlike other clinical problems, the development and maintenance of SUDs may be influenced by the immediate social environment, including the extent of peer or parent substance abuse, the availability of substances, and the prevailing societal influences. The focus of this chapter is the functional family therapy (FFT) approach for adolescents with SUDs and their families. FFT is a widely disseminated evidence-based treatment developed for youths with conduct disorder, delinquency, and other disruptive behaviors. FFT has also been implemented with families of adolescents with SUDs and has emerged as a well-established treatment for youths with alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit substance use disorders. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to FFT for clinicians in diverse settings who treat adolescents with SUDs and related problem behaviors and to serve as a guide for clinicians already familiar with FFT with respect to integrating strategies for drug-abusing youths into their FFT practice.

AB  - Runaway shelters document high levels of substance abuse among runaway youth, at least double that of school youth and there is increasing public health concern for this group over the associated risk for AIDS. Runaway youth present a constellation of problems, and research suggests that this population may be unique in the range and intensity of associated problems. The abuse and neglect experienced by these youth on the streets is compounded by societal neglect in addressing the needs of a population sorely requiring intervention. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. Given the void of treatment outcome research with these youths, and the high level of risk for health and psychological problems, there is a great need for identifying potent interventions. Although research supports the effectiveness of behavioral family therapy in reducing substance abuse among adolescents, no study has systematically applied and evaluated a family-based intervention with runaways. The proposed study is a Stage 1 behavioral treatment development project designed to examine the effectiveness of a multi-systemic behavioral family-based intervention in reducing substance use and HIV risk behaviors, while increasing family and psychological functioning in a sample of runaway adolescents.

After a typical decrease in substance use and academic problems at the end of treatment, the problems of the first subject who received no booster sessions recurred and subsequently worsened during the 8 to 18 months of followup. The other three adolescents, who responded similarly to behavioral family therapy, participated in 6 months of booster sessions which led to a second decrease in substance use and academic problems. This improvement was maintained throughout followup. The study results were consistent across differing adolescent ages, genders, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, frequencies of substance use, times of year, and lengths of treatment. These findings suggest that recurrences of problem behaviors following treatment termination could be due to extinction and that booster sessions provide intermittent reinforcement of treatment effects. 2 figures and 21 references Four 14- to 16-year-old white and Hispanic males and females participated in 5 to 12 months of behavioral family therapy.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Behavior problems are the most common reason that children and adolescents are referred to treatment. This study presents a rationale for the application of solution-focused therapy to behavior problems and tests this assumption. Children who were referred from the school setting for behavior problems (N = 239) were treated with either solution-focused therapy or "treatment-as-usual" at a school of social work-sponsored mental health clinic. Hypotheses for this quasi-experimental, pretest/posttest design were that treatment engagement would be higher in the solution-focused therapy group and that the solution-focused therapy group children over the "treatment-as-usual" group would show greater improvement according to both parent and child reports. Logistic regression and MANOVA were the data analysis procedures to test hypotheses. Findings were as follows: the solution-focused therapy group had better treatment engagement, but there were no statistically significant differences between groups on perceptions of child behaviors from either parents (Conners Parent Rating Scale) or child reports (Feelings, Attitudes, and Behaviors Scale for Children). An examination of pre- and posttest differences over time for each group indicated similar improvements in treatment according to parent reports. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Aims This paper provides a description of the rationale, study design, treatments and assessment procedures used in the Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT) experiment. Design CYT was designed to (a) test the relative effectiveness, cost and benefitcost of five promising treatment interventions under field conditions and (b) provide evidence based manual-guided models of these interventions to the treatment field. Setting The study involved two community-based treatment programs and two major medical centers.. Participants Participants were 600 adolescents recruited from the regular intake who were between the ages of 12 and 18, had used marijuana in the past 90 days, and met one or more criteria of dependence or abuse. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to one of five interventions: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family Support Network (FSN), Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA), or Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT). Measurements Self-report data were collected at intake, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post discharge using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), as well as several supplemental self-reports, collateral reports, urine testing, and service logs. Findings This paper reports on the study's implementation including the psychometric properties of the measures (alphas over 0.8), validity of self-report (kappa over 0.6), high rates of treatment completion (81% completed two or more months), and high rates of follow-up (over 94% per wave). Conclusions The feasibility of implementing the CYT manual-guided treatment and quality assurance model in community-based adolescent treatment programs is discussed.

Design CYT was designed to (a) test the relative effectiveness, cost and benefitcost of five promising treatment interventions under field conditions and (b) provide evidence based manual-guided models of these interventions to the treatment field. Setting The study involved two community-based treatment programs and two major medical centers.. Participants Participants were 600 adolescents recruited from the regular intake who were between the ages of 12 and 18, had used marijuana in the past 90 days, and met one or more criteria of dependence or abuse. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to one of five interventions: Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family Support Network (FSN), Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA), or Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT). Measurements Self-report data were collected at intake, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post discharge using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), as well as several supplemental self-reports, collateral reports, urine testing, and service logs. Findings This paper reports on the study's implementation including the psychometric properties of the measures (alphas over 0.8), validity of self-report (kappa over 0.6), high rates of treatment completion (81% completed two or more months), and high rates of follow-up (over 94% per wave). Conclusions The feasibility of implementing the CYT manual-guided treatment and quality assurance model in community-based adolescent treatment programs is discussed.

AB  - The five manual-guided treatment models tested in the Cannabis Youth Treatment study funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment are described. The five models include (a) a 6-week intervention consisting of two sessions of individual motivational enhancement therapy plus three sessions of group cognitive behavioral therapy (MET/CBTS); (b) a 12-week intervention consisting of two sessions of motivational enhancement therapy plus 10 sessions of group cognitive behavioral therapy treatment (MET/CBT12); (c) a 12-week intervention consisting of MET/CBT12 plus the family support network (FSN), a multicomponent intervention that includes parent education, family therapy and case management; (d) a 12-week intervention based on the adolescent community reinforcement approach (ACRA), an individual behavioral treatment approach designed to help adolescents and their parents reshape their environment and learn new skills: and (e) multi-dimensional family therapy (MDFT), a multi-faceted, developmentally and contextually oriented family-based model targeting individual, family and social systems. For each model, we describe the treatment background and/or its empirical support, its theoretical underpinnings, its goals and proposed treatment mechanism and the structure and content of each treatment. Procedures used for maintaining treatment fidelity and monitoring quality assurance are also described. These interventions represent the first readily available, manual-guided interventions to be evaluated in a large randomized field study for this population. Consequently, these manuals have the potential to advance treatment and research for adolescents with substance use disorders.

AB  - Interventions to reduce drug use in young people are often advocated on the basis of expert opinion or selective reviews of the scientific literature. The extent to which these views are fully supported by the scientific literature is unclear. The aim of this article is to indicate the types of secondary prevention interventions for young drug users that have been found to be effective by rigorous scientific inquiry. Some interventions are effective in reducing drug use and associated problems while others have no or mixed effect. Those successful in reducing drug use include behavior therapy, culturally sensitive counseling in residential settings, family therapy, Minnesota 12-step programs, residential care, and general drug treatment. Those with either no effect, or mixed effect, include schools interventions. Involving the family or tackling issues that are relevant to the family is of benefit across a range of interventions including, behavior therapy, family therapy, and those offered in schools. Indeed, family support is integral to the success of some programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions intended to prevent or reduce use of drugs by young people may be delivered in schools or in other settings. This review aims to summarise the current literature about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in non schools settings. OBJECTIVES: (1) - To summarise the current evidence about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in non-school settings intended to prevent or reduce drug use by young people under 25; (2) - To investigate whether interventions' effects are modified by the type and setting of the intervention, and the age of young people targeted; (3) - To identify areas where more research is needed. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966-2004), EMBASE (1980-2004), PsycInfo (1972-2004), SIGLE (1980-2004), CINAHL (1982-2004) and ASSIA (1987-2004). We searched also reference lists of review articles and retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that evaluated an intervention targeting drug use by young people under 25 years of age, delivered in a non-school setting, compared with no intervention or another intervention, that reported substantive outcomes relevant to the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results were tabulated, as studies were considered too dissimilar to combine using meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies, 9 cluster randomised studies, with 253 clusters, 8 individually randomised studies with 1230 participants, evaluating four types of intervention: motivational interviewing or brief intervention, education or skills training, family interventions and multi-component community interventions. Many studies had methodological drawbacks, especially high levels of loss to follow-up. There were too few studies for firm conclusions. One study of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on cannabis use. Three family interventions (Focus on Families, Iowa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years), each evaluated in only one study, suggested that they may be beneficial in preventing cannabis use. The studies of multi component community interventions did not find any strong effects on drug use outcomes, and the two studies of education and skills training did not find any differences between the intervention and control groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence of effectiveness of the included interventions. Motivational interviewing and some family interventions may have some benefit. Cost-effectiveness has not yet been addressed in any studies, and further research is needed to determine whether any of these interventions can be recommended. INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN NON-SCHOOL SETTINGS FOR THE PREVENTION OF DRUG USE: Drug use is widespread among young people including those still at school.Taking drugs is not a medical problem in itself but can affect physical andmental health and social functioning. People may become dependent on drugs, and use of low risk illicit drugs can escalate into use of higher risk drugs. In schools, programs have been introduced to prevent or reduce drug use among young people. Non-school settings for interventions include youth clubs, primary care centres, colleges, with families and in the community. Srategies can target entire populations or be directed at specific groups, often those at high risk. The review authors identified 17 controlled studies, 9 cluster randomised studies with 253 clusters and 8 individually randomised studies with 1230 participants. All but two of the studies were conducted in the USA. The other studies were in the UK and China. Follow-up periods varied from at completion of the intervention to six years. The studies were too few and each intervention too different to draw any firm conclusions on whether non-school based interventions prevent or reduce drug use by young people.The interventions with suggested benefits need further evaluation before it can be firmly established that they are effective. One of two studies of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on self-reported cannabis use. Three family interventions (Focus on Families, Iowa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years) were evaluated, in two separate studies, and may have been beneficial in preventing self-reported cannabis use. The latter two programs were compared to the school-based Life Skills Training program. All of the eight studies of family interventions included contact with parents, in family groups or in separate sessions for parents and their children. Multicomponent community interventions did not have any strong effects on drug use. There were five studies, four of which added the community component to a school drug education program. Education and skills training was not effective in two studies. Many of the studies lacked blinding and had high numbers of participants lost to follow up. No study reported cost outcomes BACKGROUND: Interventions intended to prevent or reduce use of drugs by young people may be delivered in schools or in other settings.

AB  - Random assignment was made of 182 clinically referred marijuana- and alcohol-abusing adolescents to one of three treatments: multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), adolescent group therapy (AGT), and multifamily educational intervention (MEI). Each treatment represented a different theory base and treatment format. All treatments were based on a manual and were delivered on a once-a-week outpatient basis. The therapists were experienced community clinicians trained to model-specific competence prior to the study and then supervised throughout the clinical trial. A theory-based multimodal assessment strategy measured symptom changes and prosocial functioning at intake, termination, and 6 and 12 months following termination. Results indicate improvement among youths in all three treatments, with MDFT showing superior improvement overall. MDFT participants also demonstrated change at the 1-year follow-up period in the important prosocial factors of school/academic performance and family functioning as measured by behavioral ratings. Results support the efficacy of MDFT, a relatively short-term, multicomponent, multitarget, family-based intervention in significantly reducing adolescent drug abuse and facilitating adaptive and protective developmental processes.

AB  - Aim To examine the efficacy of two adolescent drug abuse treatments: individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and multidimensional family therapy (MDFT). Design A 2 (treatment condition) x 4 (time) repeated-measures intent-to-treat randomized design. Data were gathered at baseline, termination, 6 and 12 months post-termination. Analyses used latent growth curve modeling. Setting Community-based drug abuse clinic in the northeastern United States. Participants A total of 224 youth, primarily male (81%), African American (72%), from low-income single-parent homes (58%) with an average age of 15 years were recruited into the study. All youth were drug users, with 75% meeting DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence and 13% meeting criteria for abuse. Measurements Five outcomes were measured: (i) substance use problem severity; (ii) 30-day frequency of cannabis use; (iii) 30-day frequency of alcohol use; (iv) 30-day frequency of other drug use; and (v) 30-day abstinence. Findings Both treatments produced significant decreases in cannabis consumption and slightly significant reductions in alcohol use, but there were no treatment differences in reducing frequency of cannabis and alcohol use. Significant treatment effects were found favoring MDFT on substance use problem severity, other drug use and minimal use (zero or one occasion of use) of all substances, and these effects continued to 12 months following treatment termination. Conclusion Both interventions are promising treatments. Consistent with previous controlled trials, MDFT is distinguished by the sustainability of treatment effects.

AB  - Multisystemic therapy (MST) is a family- and community-based treatment of serious emotional and behavioural problems presented by adolescents. The development of this model began in the late 1970s, and today MST is a leading evidence-based treatment of serious antisocial behaviour in youths, with programs transported to more than 30 states in the United States and 12 nations, including Australia and New Zealand. This article reviews the theoretical rationale that underlies MST and presents the central clinical features of the intervention model. In addition, the training and quality assurance protocols used to promote MST program fidelity and treatment adherence are described. Finally, findings from approximately I 5 published randomised and two quasi-experimental clinical trials with youths presenting serious clinical problems (e.g., violence, substance abuse, serious emotional disturbance, sexual offending, and chronic illness) are summarised.

AB  - We examined the effectiveness of behavioural family therapy (following the treatment agenda outlined in Fleischman, Horne and Arthur, 1983) and brief family therapy (following the procedures outlined in Fisch, Weakland and Segal, 1985), in the treatment of child psychological disorders. The parents of the 49 children referred to the outpatient unit of a children's hospital completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach and Edelbrock, 1983). Three scales of the CBCL were examined to assess the effectiveness of the two therapeutic approaches pre- to post-treatment. Significant pre- and post-treatment differences were found for behavioural family therapy on the Internalizing, Externalizing, and Sum T scales and for brief family therapy on the Internalizing and Sum T scales. Sum T scales represent the sum of scores across all sub-scales of the CBCL. Neither treatment was found to be more effective than the other.

AB  - The initial onset of bipolar disorder occurs in childhood or adolescence in about 50% of patients. Early-onset forms of the disorder have a poorer prognosis than adult-onset forms and are frequently characterized by comorbid substance abuse. Clinical trials research suggests that family psychoeducational approaches are effective adjuncts to medication in stabilizing the symptoms of bipolar disorder in adults and youth, although their efficacy in patients with comorbid substance use disorders has not been systematically investigated. This article describes the family-focused treatment (FFT) of a late adolescent with bipolar disorder and polysubstance dependence. The treatment of this patient and family required adapting FFT to consider the family's structure, dysfunctional alliance patterns, and unresolved conflicts from early in the family's history. The case illustrates the importance of conducting manual-based behavioral family treatments with a psychotherapeutic attitude, including addressing unstated emotional conflicts and resistances that may impede progress. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc The initial onset of bipolar disorder occurs in childhood or adolescence in about 50% of patients.

AB  - Program comparison is needed to evaluate the effectiveness that each program has on similar populations. This study comparatively evaluated an evidence based program and a theory based program designed for intervention with high risk children. The evidence based program used in this study was functional family therapy, and the theory based program was intensive in-home. The comparison of programs was based on archival data assessing parental perception of change in symptomology. Forty-seven parents completed pre and post Youth Outcome Questionnaires for the functional family therapy program and 48 parents completed pre and post Youth Outcome Questionnaires for the intensive in-home program. ANOVA and t-test analyses were used that resulted in significant differences for each program's individual effectiveness. However, when compared, neither program was shown more effective over the other. This study highlights the necessity for program evaluation, particularly in terms of evaluating multiple treatment approaches for specific populations.

This study examines the relationship between waiting time and treatment engagement among 2,054 youth referred to an evidence based treatment (EBT). Findings indicate that families are more likely to refuse services if they face longer waiting times. Families exposed to a prolonged waiting time were also more likely to drop out prematurely from Functional Family Therapy, but this relationship was not significant among youth receiving Multisystemic Therapy. Implications for EBT implementation and strategies for engaging families are discussed.

AB  - Substance use disorders have a profound impact on the course of severe mental illnesses and on the family, but little research has evaluated the impact of family intervention for this population. To address this question, a randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing a brief (2-3 mo) Family Education (ED) program with a longer-term (9-18 mo) program that combined education with teaching communication and problem-solving skills, Family Intervention for Dual Disorders (FIDD). A total of 108 clients (77% schizophrenia-spectrum) and a key relative were randomized to either ED or FIDD and assessed at baseline and every 6 months for 3 years. Rates of retention of families in both programs were moderate. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that clients in both programs improved in psychiatric, substance abuse, and functional outcomes, as did key relatives in knowledge of co-occurring disorders, burden, and mental health functioning. Clients in FIDD had significantly less severe overall psychiatric symptoms and psychotic symptoms and tended to improve more in functioning. Relatives in FIDD improved more in mental health functioning and knowledge of co-occurring disorders. There were no consistent differences between the programs in substance abuse severity or family burden. The findings support the utility of family intervention for co-occurring disorders, and the added benefits of communication and problem-solving training, but also suggest the need to modify these programs to retain more families in treatment in order to provide them with the information and skills they need to overcome the effects of these disorders Substance use disorders have a profound impact on the course of severe mental illnesses and on the family, but little research has evaluated the impact of family intervention for this population.

AB  - This study examined the degree of disagreement between runaway adolescents and their primary caretakers, defined as informant discrepancies, on their view of their family. How these discrepancies changed over time and whether family therapy or individual therapy could impact that change were also explored. The current sample (N=179 dyads) included adolescent substance abusers residing in a runaway shelter and their primary caretakers. Adolescent gender was examined as a correlate of change, and treatment attendance was controlled. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to measure discrepancies between the individuals within a dyad. Results showed that among those receiving family therapy, but not individual therapy, informant discrepancies decreased significantly over time. Additionally, dyads with a male adolescent showed a significantly slower rate of improvement in discrepancy scores across time compared with dyads with a female adolescent. Previous research indicates that lower levels of discrepant perceptions are associated with better individual and relationship functioning. Therefore, this study's findings support family therapy as superior to individual therapy for addressing parentchild discrepanciespossibly through its focus on improving family communication, perspective taking, and understanding This study examined the degree of disagreement between runaway adolescents and their primary caretakers, defined as informant discrepancies, on their view of their family.

AB  - Purpose: Prompted by calls to implement evidence-based practices (EBPs) into residential care settings (RCS), this review addresses three questions: (1) Which EBPs have been tested with children and youth within the context of RCS? (2) What is the evidence for their effectiveness within such settings? (3) What implementation issues arise when transporting EBPs into RCS? Methods: Evidence-based psychosocial interventions and respective outcome studies, published from 1990 to 2012, were identified through a multi-phase search process, involving the review of four major clearinghouse websites and relevant electronic databases. To be included, effectiveness had to have been previously established through a comparison group design regardless of the setting, and interventions tested subsequently with youth in RCS. All outcome studies were evaluated for quality and bias using a structured appraisal tool. Results: Ten interventions matching a priori criteria were identified: Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Aggression Replacement Training, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Eye Movement and Desensitization Therapy, Functional Family Therapy, Multimodal Substance Abuse Prevention, Residential Student Assistance Program, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, and Trauma Intervention Program for Adjudicated and At-Risk Youth. Interventions were tested in 13 studies, which were conducted in different types of RCS, using a variety of study methods. Outcomes were generally positive, establishing the relative effectiveness of the interventions with youth in RCS across a range of psychosocial outcomes. However, concerns about methodological bias and confounding factors remain. Most studies addressed implementation issues, reporting on treatment adaptations, training and supervision, treatment fidelity and implementation barriers. Conclusion: The review unearthed a small but important body of knowledge that demonstrates that EBPs can be implemented in RCS with encouraging results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: In a recent randomized controlled trial (Hendriks et al., 2011), multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) were equally effective in reducing cannabis use in adolescents (13-18 years old) with a cannabis use disorder (n = 109). In a secondary analysis of the trial data, we investigated which pretreatment patient characteristics differentially predicted treatment effect in MDFT and CBT, in order to generate hypotheses for future patient-treatment matching. Methods: The predictive value of twenty patient characteristics, in the area of demographic background, substance use, substance-related problems, delinquency, treatment history, psychopathology, family functioning and school or work related problems, was investigated in bivariate and subsequent multivariate linear regression analyses, with baseline to month 12 reductions in cannabis use days and smoked joints as dependent variables. Results: Older adolescents (17-18 years old) benefited considerably more from CBT, and younger adolescents considerably more from MDFT (p < 0.01). Similarly, adolescents with a past year conduct or oppositional defiant disorder, and those with internalizing problems achieved considerably better results in MDFT, while those without these coexisting psychiatric problems benefited much more from CBT (p < 0.01, and p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: The current study strongly suggests that age, disruptive behavior disorders and internalizing problems are important treatment effect moderators of MDFT and CBT in adolescents with a cannabis use disorder. If replicated, this finding suggests directions for future patient-treatment matching in adolescent substance abuse treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the system-level effects of implementing a promising treatment for adolescent substance abuse in juvenile drug courts (JDCs). Six JDCs were randomized to receive training in the experimental intervention (contingency management-family engagement [CM-FAM)] or to continue their usual services (US). Participants were 104 families served by the courts, 5 I therapists, and 74 JDC stakeholders (e.g., judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys). Assessments included repeated measurements of CM-FAM implementation by therapists and therapist and stakeholder perceptions of incentive-based interventions and organizational characteristics. Results revealed greater use of CM and family engagement techniques among CM-FAM relative to US therapists. In addition, therapists and stakeholders in the CM-FAM condition reported more favorable attitudes toward the use of incentives and greater improvement on several domains of organizational functioning relative to US counterparts. Taken together, these findings suggest that JDC professionals are amenable to the adoption and implementation of a treatment model that holds promise for improving youth outcomes.

AB  - The current study reports results from a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT) for reducing substance use risk and trauma-related mental health problems among sexually assaulted adolescents. Thirty adolescents (aged 13-17 years; M = 14.80; SD = 1.51) who had experienced at least one sexual assault and their caregivers were randomized to RRFT or treatment as usual (TAU) conditions. Participants completed measures of substance use, substance use risk factors (e.g., family functioning), mental health problems (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and general internalizing/externalizing symptoms) and risky sexual behavior at four time points (baseline, posttreatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up). Mixed-effects regression models yielded significantly greater reductions in substance use, specific substance use risk factors, and (parent-reported) PTSD, depression, and general internalizing symptoms among youth in the RRFT condition relative to youth in the TAU condition. However, significant baseline differences in functioning between the two conditions warrant caution in interpreting between-groups findings. Instead, emphasis is placed on replication of feasibility findings and within-group improvements over time among the RRFT youth The current study reports results from a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of Risk Reduction through Family Therapy (RRFT) for reducing substance use risk and trauma-related mental health problems among sexually assaulted adolescents.

AB  - Background. Cannabis use by people with schizophrenia has been found to be associated with family distress and poor clinical outcomes. Interventions to reduce drug use in this patient group have had limited efficacy. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a novel intervention for parents of young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia consisting of family-based motivational interviewing and interaction skills (Family Motivational Intervention, FMI) in comparison with routine family support (RFS). Method. In a trial with 75 patients who used cannabis and received treatment for recent-onset schizophrenia, 97 parents were randomly assigned to either FMI (n=53) or RFS (n=44). Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3 months after completion of the family intervention by an investigator who remained blind throughout the study about the assignment of the parents. Results. At follow-up, patients' frequency and quantity of cannabis use was significantly more reduced in FMI than in RFS (p<0.05 and p<0.04 respectively). Patients' craving for cannabis was also significantly reduced in FMI whereas there was a small increase in RFS (p=0.01). There was no difference between FMI and RFS with regard to patients' other substance use and general level of functioning. Both groups showed significant improvements in parental distress and sense of burden. Conclusions. Training parents in motivational interviewing and interaction skills is feasible and effective in reducing cannabis use among young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia. However, FMI was not more effective than RFS in increasing patients' general level of functioning and in reducing parents' stress and sense of burden Background.

AB  - The aims of the present study were, first, to establish the effect of brief, in-home intensive family preservation programs on prevention of out-of-home placement, family functioning, child behavior problems and social support and, second, to study moderators of these effects. The results of this meta-analytic study, consisting of 20 studies (31,369 participants), show that intensive family preservation programs had a medium and positive effect on family functioning (d=.486), but were generally not effective in preventing out-of-home placement. Intensive family preservation programs were effective in preventing placement for multiproblem families, but not for families experiencing abuse and neglect. Moreover, the effect on out-of-home placement proved to be moderated by client characteristics (sex and age of the child, parent age, number of children in the family, single-parenthood, non-white ethnicity), program characteristics (caseload), study characteristics (study design and study quality), and publication characteristics (publication type, publication year and journal impact factor). The discussion addresses implications for evaluation and practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study documents significant differences in alliance in a predominantly Latino sample of adolescents who either completed or dropped out of a Guided Self-Change treatment program. Therapeutic alliance, working alliance, and patient involvement were assessed via ratings of audio-recorded segments of participants' counseling sessions. Descriptive discriminant function analysis identified working alliance goals, patient participation, and therapist warmth and friendliness variables as significantly predictive of completion status. These results were confirmed via follow-up logistic regression analyses. The use of brief clinical tools to monitor and manage alliance among adolescents receiving treatment who are at risk for dropout is discussed This study documents significant differences in alliance in a predominantly Latino sample of adolescents who either completed or dropped out of a Guided Self-Change treatment program.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effectiveness of brief strategic family therapy (BSFT; an evidence-based family therapy) compared to treatment as usual (TAU) as provided in community-based adolescent outpatient drug abuse programs. Method: A randomized effectiveness trial in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network compared BSFT to TAU with a multiethnic sample of adolescents (213 Hispanic, 148 White, and 110 Black) referred for drug abuse treatment at 8 community treatment agencies nationwide. Randomization encompassed both adolescents' families (n = 480) and the agency therapists (n = 49) who provided either TAU or BSFT services. The primary outcome was adolescent drug use, assessed monthly via adolescent self-report and urinalysis for up to 1 year post randomization. Secondary outcomes included treatment engagement (>= 2 sessions), retention (>= 8 sessions), and participants' reports of family functioning 4, 8, and 12 months following randomization. Results: No overall differences between conditions were observed in the trajectories of self-reports of adolescent drug use. However, the median number of days of self-reported drug use was significantly higher, chi(2)(1) = 5.40, p < .02, in TAU (Mdn = 3.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 11) than BSFT (Mdn = 2, IQR = 9) at the final observation point. BSFT was significantly more effective than TAU in engaging, chi(2)(1) = 11.33, p < .001, and retaining, chi(2)(1) = 5.66, p < .02, family members in treatment and in improving parent reports of family functioning, chi(2)(2) = 9.10, p < .011.

AB  - Objective: Therapist adherence has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in family therapy. In prior studies, adherence has been represented broadly by core principles and a consistent family (vs. individual) focus. To date, these studies have not captured the range of clinical skills that are represented in complex family-based approaches or examined how variations in these skills predict different clinically relevant outcomes over the course of treatment. In this study, the authors examined the reliability and validity of an observational adherence measure and the relationship between adherence and outcome in a sample of drug-using adolescents who received brief strategic family therapy within a multisite effectiveness study. Method: Participants were 480 adolescents (age 12-17) and their family members, who were randomized to the Brief Strategic Family Therapist treatment condition (J. Szapocznik, U. Hervis. & S. Schwartz, 2003) or treatment as usual. The adolescents were mostly male (377 vs. 103 female) and Hispanic (213), whereas 148 were White, and 110 were Black. Therapists were also randomly assigned to treatment condition within agencies. Results: Results supported the proposed factor structure of the adherence measure, providing evidence that it is possible to capture and discriminate between distinct dimensions of family therapy. Analyses demonstrated that the mean levels of the factors varied over time in theoretically and clinically relevant ways and that therapist adherence was associated with engagement and retention in treatment, improvements in family functioning, and reductions in adolescent drug use. Conclusions: Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed, including the relevance of these findings on training therapists and studies focusing on mechanisms of action in family therapy Objective: Therapist adherence has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in family therapy.
