Description: Provides a comprehensive set of tools for descriptive statistics,
    graphical data exploration, outlier detection, homoscedasticity testing, and
    multiple comparison procedures. Includes manual implementations of Levene's test,
    Bartlett's test, and the Fligner-Killeen test, as well as post hoc comparison
    methods such as Tukey, Scheffé, Games-Howell, Brunner-Munzel, and others.
    This version introduces two new procedures: the Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test
    and the Jarque-Bera test with Glinskiy's (2024) correction. Designed for use in
    teaching, applied statistical analysis, and reproducible research.
